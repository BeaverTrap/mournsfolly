### **Traits**

- **Predatory Transformation.**  
  Barstow cloaks himself in shadowy illusions, appearing larger or subtly displacing his form. In dim light or darkness, he has advantage on Stealth checks, and attack rolls from non-magical sources have disadvantage against him.

- **Dark Resilience.**  
  While in dim light or darkness, Barstow gains resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. He regains 10 hit points at the start of his turn if he has at least 1 HP.

- **Psychic Influence.**  
  Barstow imposes dread on a creature within 30 feet. The target must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature must stay at least 15 feet away from Barstow and cannot willingly move closer.

- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day).**  
  If Barstow fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

- **Relentless Will.**  
  If Barstow drops to 0 HP outside his resting place, he becomes incorporeal. In this form, he cannot take actions or interact with objects, moves at half speed (15 ft.), and must reach his resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Attacks against him have advantage, and he is vulnerable to radiant damage.

### **Actions**

- **Multiattack.**  
  Barstow makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.

- **Unarmed Strike.**  
  *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
  *Hit:* 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, Barstow can grapple the target (escape DC 18).

- **Bite.**  
  *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature or a creature that is grappled.  
  *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage, and Barstow regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. A humanoid slain this way and buried rises as a vampire spawn under Barstow's control.

- **Charm.**  
  Barstow targets one humanoid within 30 feet. The target must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 24 hours, regarding Barstow as a trusted friend. This effect ends early if Barstow harms the target.

- **Children of the Night (1/Day).**  
  Barstow magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats or 3d6 wolves (if outdoors). These creatures act as allies and obey his commands for 1 hour.

### **Legendary Actions**

Barstow can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. Barstow regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

- **Move.**  
  Barstow moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

- **Unarmed Strike.**  
  Barstow makes one unarmed strike.

### **Appearance and Motivations**

**Appearance:**  
Walter Barstow is a gaunt figure with translucent skin stretched over his skeletal frame. His glowing, unnatural eyes pierce the darkness, and his elongated limbs end in claw-like hands. His presence inspires dread, as his appearance is a chilling reminder of his monstrous nature.

**Motivations:**  
Barstow sees Mourn's Folly as a resource to exploit. Using manipulation and fear, he drains the town of its vitality while turning useful individuals into feral vampires or thralls. Once the town is consumed, he moves on, leaving only ruin in his wake.

**Personality:**  
Cold and calculating, Barstow uses fear and manipulation to dominate. He values precision and control over chaos, viewing every life as a resource to exploit or discard.
