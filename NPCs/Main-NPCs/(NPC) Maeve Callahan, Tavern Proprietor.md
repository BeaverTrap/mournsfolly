### **Traits**

- **Observant Host.**  
  Maeve can't be surprised and has advantage on Perception checks within her tavern. She notices details about her patrons that others may overlook, making her a great source for rumors and town gossip.

- **Comforting Presence (1/Short Rest).**  
  Maeve has a calming presence that can alleviate tension. As an action, she can grant advantage on Wisdom saving throws against fear or charm effects to a creature within 10 feet of her for 1 hour.

- **Rumor Mill.**  
  Maeve can be persuaded to share insights about recent events, people, or the state of the town with a successful DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check. Failing this roll by 5 or more results in her playfully dodging the question.
