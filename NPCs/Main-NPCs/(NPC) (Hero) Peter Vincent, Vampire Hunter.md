### **Traits**

- **Silver-Tongued.**  
  Peter has advantage on Persuasion checks to convince others of his knowledge or competence in vampire hunting.

- **Undead Lore.**  
  Due to his experience, Peter has advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks related to undead, particularly vampires. He also has advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to detect vampire behavior.

- **Spellcasting.**  
  Peter is a 5th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following spells prepared:

  - **Cantrips (at will):** *Light*, *Vicious Mockery*  
  - **1st level (4 slots):** *Faerie Fire*, *Healing Word*, *Heroism*  
  - **2nd level (3 slots):** *Shatter*, *Enhance Ability*  
  - **3rd level (2 slots):** *Dispel Magic*, *Bestow Curse*  

- **Bardic Inspiration (5/Long Rest).**  
  Peter can inspire others through stirring words or music. As a bonus action, he can give one creature within 60 feet an inspiration die (1d8) to add to a roll within the next 10 minutes.

### **Actions**

- **Rapier.**  
  *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
  *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage.

- **Crossbow.**  
  *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target.  
  *Hit:* 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage.

- **Turn Undead (1/Day).**  
  Peter can channel his faith to repel undead creatures within 30 feet. Each undead must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be forced to flee for 1 minute.

---

### **Reactions**

- **Cutting Words.**  
  When a creature Peter can see within 60 feet makes an attack roll, ability check, or damage roll, Peter can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration to reduce the result by 1d8, potentially causing a miss or failure.

## **Peter Vincent, Vampire Hunter Extraordinaire**

### **Role:**  
Former stage actor, now self-proclaimed "Vampire Hunter."

---

### **Personality:**

- **Flamboyant and theatrical.**  
  Peter's confidence often masks his insecurities. Known for his grand gestures and flair, he's charmingly self-assured but occasionally stumbles in genuinely dangerous situations. Though once a skeptic, his brush with real vampires left him both horrified and resolute in his new calling. He sometimes still slips into "performance mode," his bravado shining through even in the heat of battle.

---

### **Background:**

Peter Vincent once made a modest name for himself in live theater, specializing in supernatural tales where he portrayed vampire hunters and demon slayers. An unexpected encounter with a real vampire turned his life around, leading him to adopt the persona he'd once only played. Now, Peter roams with a genuine purpose: hunting down the undead.

---

### **Connection to Plot:**

Peter arrives in *Mourn's Folly* in Act 3, as Barstow's influence peaks. His dramatic flair and knowledge of supernatural creatures make him an intriguing stranger. His bardic talents and actual understanding of vampires quickly prove his worth to the party. Though the townsfolk may see him as an outsider, Peter offers insights and spells that bolster the PCs' chances against Barstow's thralls.

---

### **Peter's Gear and Skills**

- **Weapon:** *Crossbow of the Undead's Bane*  
  A prop from his theater days, enchanted after his run-in with a real vampire. Deals an additional 1d4 radiant damage to undead, with a +1 bonus to hit.

- **Gadget:** *Sunburst Powder*  
  Originally used for dramatic stage effects, this powder creates a 10-foot sphere of dim light for one round. Undead in the area have disadvantage on attacks and saving throws.
