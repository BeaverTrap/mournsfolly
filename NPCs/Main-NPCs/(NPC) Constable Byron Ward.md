### **Traits**

- **Sharp Investigator.**  
  Byron has advantage on Investigation checks in *Mourn's Folly*, being deeply familiar with the town's layout and routines.

- **Shield of Authority.**  
  Once per short rest, Byron can use his authority to gain advantage on a Charisma check to get information or calm a tense situation, though he falters when in real danger.

- **Coward's Instinct.**  
  When Byron is below half health or faces supernatural threats, he has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws and is likely to flee if possible. As the town's troubles worsen, he may consider abandoning his post entirely.

## **Description**

Constable Byron Ward is a cautious, well-meaning man who takes his role as protector seriouslyâ€”when it's easy. Known for his calm authority, he is often respected, though he secretly fears the very idea of supernatural dangers.  

As strange happenings increase around *Mourn's Folly*, Byron begins to feel he's in over his head. Rationalizing that the town is already doomed, he starts making quiet plans to abandon his post, hoping to slip away unnoticed if things get dire.  

His actions betray a deep-seated fear of what he cannot control, showing him to be more of a pragmatic survivor than a hero.
