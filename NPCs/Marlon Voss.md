### **Traits**

- **Spellcasting.**  
  Voss is a 7th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). Voss has the following spells prepared:  
  **Cantrips (at will):** *Minor Illusion*, *Friends*, *Message*, *Thaumaturgy*  
  **1st level (4 slots):** *Charm Person*, *Disguise Self*, *Detect Magic*, *Shield*  
  **2nd level (3 slots):** *Suggestion*, *Mirror Image*, *Hold Person*  
  **3rd level (3 slots):** *Counterspell*, *Fear*  
  **4th level (1 slot):** *Greater Invisibility*

- **Silver Tongue.**  
  Voss has advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to mislead, hide the truth, or charm others.

- **Dark Gift of the Servant.**  
  Voss is resistant to necrotic damage and has darkvision up to 60 feet, granted by his pact with Barstow. Additionally, he has a bond with Barstow that allows him to telepathically communicate with the vampire within a 1-mile radius.

- **Master Manipulator.**  
  Voss can spend 1 minute speaking with a humanoid within 5 feet and make a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check. If successful, he plants a subtle, lasting suggestion in the target's mind, influencing it to trust Voss implicitly. The effect lasts for up to 24 hours or until the target is harmed by Voss or his allies.

### **Actions**

- **Multiattack.**  
  Voss makes two melee attacks.

- **Rapier.**  
  *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
  *Hit:* 8 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.

- **Beguiling Gaze.** (Recharge 5–6)  
  Voss can focus his gaze on one creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed for 1 minute. While charmed, the creature is friendly to Voss and regards him as a trusted ally. This effect ends if the creature takes damage or if Voss attacks it or forces it to make a saving throw.

- **Manipulative Words (1/Day).**  
  Voss speaks in a way that subtly bends the will of those around him. Each creature of Voss's choice within 30 feet that can hear him must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by him for 10 minutes. While charmed, they have disadvantage on checks made to resist persuasion or intimidation from Voss. This charm ends early if Voss or his allies attack the creature.

### **Tactics**

Voss prefers manipulation and evasion over direct combat. He uses *Mirror Image* or *Greater Invisibility* to avoid damage and *Fear* to scatter foes. His charm abilities and spells are aimed at creating distractions or persuading opponents to turn on each other.

### **Marlon Voss Backstory**

**Background:**  
Marlon Voss is more than just a smooth-talking servant; he's a calculating opportunist who sees in Barstow's power a way to elevate himself far beyond ordinary mortals. A former dealer in arcane relics, Voss once chanced upon Barstow during his dealings in shadowy markets, becoming captivated by the vampire's longevity and influence. Voss willingly entered into Barstow's service, eager to learn the secrets of immortality or at least a path to supernatural power that could sustain him through the ages. His loyalty is deeply self-serving; he believes that assisting Barstow will ultimately reward him with dark gifts of his own.

**Role in Mourn's Folly:**  
Voss took the lead in establishing both the antique shop and the renovation of the Mournstead Mansion, knowing that these "legitimate" fronts would help veil Barstow's darker intentions. His personable charm and persuasive skills made the townsfolk comfortable with his plans, even convincing many to assist with the mansion's repairs. While he's quick to divert questions about Barstow's location, he subtly gathers the townsfolk's personal information, identifying those who might be suitable "gifts" for Barstow's hunger once the vampire arrives.

**Intentions and Manipulations:**  
Once Barstow's casket arrives on the first shipment to the antique shop, Voss will have his full instructions. He will use his charm to isolate townsfolk—likely starting with those most curious about the mansion or those with fragile dispositions. For Voss, it's a game of gradual control; he aims to keep the townsfolk unsuspecting while gradually turning them into resources for Barstow's insatiable hunger. Under Voss's influence, the townsfolk will be unwittingly drawn closer to Barstow, initially as mere customers or visitors to the shop, then potentially as victims.
