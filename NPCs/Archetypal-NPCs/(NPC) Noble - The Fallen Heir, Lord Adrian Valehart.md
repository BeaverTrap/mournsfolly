# **Lord Adrian Valehart, The Fallen Heir**

**Role in Mourn's Folly:**  
A fallen noble striving to reclaim lost glory, Adrian is a natural leader who uses strategy and charisma to navigate both social and physical conflicts. He struggles with the weight of his family's tarnished legacy but remains steadfast in his determination to protect the town from the growing darkness.

**Personality:**  
Adrian is pragmatic and driven, often masking his doubts with a composed demeanor. He is loyal to his allies and highly protective of Mourn's Folly, though he harbors a deep resentment for those who underestimate him or his family.

**Personality When Turned:**  
As a vampire, Adrian's loyalty becomes warped into obsession. His protective instincts transform into a controlling dominance, viewing the town and its people as assets to be manipulated. Moments of his former self resurface, but they are often drowned out by his hunger for power and blood.

**Residence in Mourn's Folly:**  
Lord Adrian resides in a crumbling manor on the town's outskirts, maintaining an air of faded grandeur. The residence reflects his struggle to hold onto his noble past while facing a rapidly changing world. (*Located in Building 38*)
