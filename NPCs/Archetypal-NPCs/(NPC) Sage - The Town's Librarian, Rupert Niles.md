- **Claws.**  
  *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
  *Hit:* 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage. Instead of dealing damage, Rupert can grapple the target (escape DC 14).

- **Bite.**  
  *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled, incapacitated, or restrained.  
  *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Rupert regains hit points equal to that amount.

### **Reactions**

- **Arcane Counter.**  
  When Rupert is targeted by a spell, he can use his reaction to make an Arcana check (DC equal to the spell's save DC). On a success, the spell is negated, and Rupert regains 5 hit points.
