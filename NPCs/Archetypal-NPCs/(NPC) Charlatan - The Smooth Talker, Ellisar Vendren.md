### **Ellisar Vendren, The Smooth Talker**

**Role in Mourn's Folly:**  
Ellisar is a half-elf with a disarming smile and a knack for slipping into any crowd unnoticed. Returning to Mourn's Folly after years of cons and scams, Ellisar claims they’ve reformed. They’ve been renting a room at **The Folly’s Rest Tavern**, staying close to the town's bustling activity and keeping an ear out for gossip.

**Personality:**

- **Normal:** Witty, adaptable, and charming, but always looking for the next opportunity. Beneath the confidence lies a restless spirit and a desire to stay ahead of past mistakes.
- **Turned:** Their charm becomes predatory, manipulating and exploiting others with cold precision. Flashes of guilt and self-loathing arise when reminded of their former self.

**Residence in Mourn's Folly:**  
Ellisar resides in a modest room above **The Folly’s Rest Tavern**, a lively hub in the heart of the town. Their room is sparsely decorated, save for a sturdy lockbox and a small desk. Its location allows Ellisar to gather gossip and stay connected with the townsfolk and visitors.

**Strengths:**

- Expert manipulator, skilled in reading and influencing others.
- Quick thinker, adept at improvisation when plans go awry.
- Charismatic and resourceful, making them a natural negotiator.

**Weaknesses:**

- Reluctant to engage in direct combat, relying on stealth and deception.
- Distrusted by those familiar with their past misdeeds.
- Vulnerable when schemes unravel, as they rely heavily on secrecy.

**Plot Hooks:**

- **Hidden Information:** Ellisar holds knowledge about the Mournstead Mansion’s new occupants but requires leverage or payment to share.
- **Double-Cross:** Ellisar’s loyalty is fluid and may betray the party if offered a better deal.
- **Grand Scheme:** Ellisar has a plan to con a powerful figure in Mourn’s Folly. The party can choose to thwart or assist them.
- **Turned Manipulator:** If corrupted, Ellisar becomes a dangerous vampire, playing both sides to their advantage.
