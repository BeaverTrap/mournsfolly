  Ellowyn makes two attacks: one with their claws and one with their bite.

- **Claws.**  
  *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
  *Hit:* 9 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage. Instead of dealing damage, Ellowyn can grapple the target (escape DC 15).

- **Bite.**  
  *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled, incapacitated, or restrained.  
  *Hit:* 10 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by the necrotic damage dealt, and Ellowyn regains hit points equal to that amount.
