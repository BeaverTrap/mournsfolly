### **Traits**

- **Enhanced Craftsmanship.**  
    Drenna retains her skill as a master artisan, now twisted by her vampiric state. Magical items she creates or repairs while turned carry faint malevolent energy, causing unease in those who use them.
    
- **Regeneration.**  
    Drenna regains 10 hit points at the start of her turn if she has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If she takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of her next turn.
    
- **Spider Climb.**  
    Drenna can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
    
- **Sunlight Sensitivity.**  
    While in sunlight, Drenna has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks and takes 20 radiant damage at the start of each turn.

### **Actions**

- **Multiattack.**  
    Drenna makes three attacks: two with her claws and one with her bite.
    
- **Claws.**  
    _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
    _Hit:_ 9 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage. Instead of dealing damage, Drenna can grapple the target (escape DC 14).
    
- **Bite.**  
    _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by Drenna, incapacitated, or restrained.  
    _Hit:_ 8 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 9 (2d6 + 3) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Drenna regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
    
- **Molten Strike (Recharge 6).**  
    Infusing her vampiric strength with her artisan skills, Drenna's hammer glows red-hot.  
    _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
    _Hit:_ 18 (4d8) fire damage.
