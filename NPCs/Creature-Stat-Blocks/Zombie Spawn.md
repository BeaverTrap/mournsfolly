### **Special Traits**

### **Actions**

- **Grasping Bite:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
    - _Hit:_ 5 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a **DC 13 Strength saving throw** or be grappled by the "Zombie" Spawn (escape DC 13). While grappled in this way, the target is restrained, and the spawn can use its **Feeding Frenzy** attack on subsequent turns.
- **Feeding Frenzy:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ Automatically hits a creature grappled by the spawn.
    - _Hit:_ 4 (1d4 + 2) necrotic damage, and the target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

### **Behavior and Combat**

- **Relentless Hunger:** Zombie Vampire Spawns fixate on a victim after initiating a grapple, continuing to feed until forcibly removed or the victim is drained.
- **Lack of Self-Preservation:** Spawns ignore pain or threats around them, focused solely on feeding. They attack recklessly without regard for their survival.
- **Weakness to Radiant and Fire Effects:** Sunlight, radiant magic, or fire can quickly disrupt their feeding and force them into retreat.

---

### **Decisive Defeat Conditions**

- **Prolonged Sunlight Exposure:** Zombie Vampire Spawns ignite after **3 consecutive rounds (18 seconds)** of direct sunlight exposure, turning to ash.
- **Stake to the Heart:** A spawn can be permanently destroyed by staking it through the heart while incapacitated.

### **"Zombie" Spawn Description**

Zombie Vampire Spawns are grotesque, mindless husks of their former selves. With their pale, lifeless skin and broken teeth, they appear more like traditional zombies than vampires. Their savage, uncoordinated movements and relentless hunger strike fear into their victims. These creatures are often mistaken for ordinary undead until their vampiric feeding habits become evident.
