### **Variant: Diseased Giant Rat**

Some giant rats carry vile diseases that they spread with their bites.

- **Bite.**  
    _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
    _Hit:_ 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease.
    
    - **Effect of Disease:** Until cured, the target cannot regain hit points except by magical means, and the target's hit point maximum decreases by 3 (1d6) every 24 hours. If the target's hit point maximum drops to 0 due to this disease, the target dies.
