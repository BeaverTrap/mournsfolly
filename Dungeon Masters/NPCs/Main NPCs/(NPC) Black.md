### **Traits**

- **Silver Tongue.** Black has advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks when negotiating deals or resolving disputes.
    
- **Canny Merchant.** Black can identify the approximate value and rarity of any magical or non-magical item with a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) or Wisdom (Insight) check.
    
- **Morally Ambiguous Reputation.** Black’s reputation grants them an air of authority. NPCs from Mournstead Folly are more likely to comply with Black’s requests unless doing so would harm their interests or safety.
    
- **Evasion.** If Black is subjected to an effect that allows a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, they take no damage on a successful save, and only half damage on a failed save.

### **Actions**

- **Dagger.**  
    _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
    _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.
    
- **Wit and Warning (Recharge 5-6).**  
    Black delivers an inspiring quip or a shrewd observation. Up to three creatures of Black’s choice within 30 feet that can hear them gain temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + Black’s Charisma modifier (minimum of 5).
    
- **Shadow Trade (1/Day).**  
    Black can pull an item seemingly from nowhere (via hidden compartments, sleight of hand, or secret resources). The item is a common or uncommon magic item, but it remains in Black’s possession for only 24 hours unless they already own it.

### **Reactions**

- **Disarming Wit.** When a creature within 5 feet of Black misses them with an attack, Black can use their reaction to impose disadvantage on the creature’s next attack roll before the end of its next turn.

## **Role in Mourn’s Folly**

Black is the charismatic and sharp-witted proprietor of **Black’s Market**, a morally ambiguous but fully accepted establishment located openly on Market Street in Mournstead Folly. Though their business deals in both mundane and rare goods—some of which have questionable origins—Black has earned the respect of the townsfolk through years of reliability and occasional altruism. They are pragmatic, seeing their market as both a service and a way to maintain influence in the town.
