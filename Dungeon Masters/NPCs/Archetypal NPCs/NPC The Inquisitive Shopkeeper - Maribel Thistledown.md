# **Maribel Thistledown, The Inquisitive Shopkeeper**

**Role in Mourn's Folly:**  
Maribel is a central NPC providing players with unique items, local gossip, and connections to other characters and events.

**Personality:**  
Maribel is outgoing, witty, and perpetually curious. She loves knowing everything about everyone and has a knack for extracting information without others realizing it. While her warmth and humor make her well-liked, her nosiness can rub some people the wrong way, particularly those with secrets to keep.

**Personality When Turned:**  
Her love of gossip mutates into a darker obsession, using her knowledge to manipulate and control others. She remains outwardly charming but exudes an air of menace, using her insight into others' weaknesses to dominate and coerce.

**Residence in Mourn's Folly:**  
Maribel lives in a cozy apartment above her general store. The space is packed with ledgers, trinkets, and a personal archive of local rumors and stories. (*Located in the General Store building*)

- **Resourcefulness:** Maribel is quick to adapt to changing circumstances, whether in the market or during more dangerous situations.

---

### **Weaknesses**

- **Curiosity as a Flaw:** Maribel's inquisitive nature can sometimes lead her into trouble, as she tends to pry into matters best left undisturbed.  
- **Unarmed Vulnerability:** While she is clever and persuasive, Maribel lacks significant combat training, making her reliant on allies for physical protection.  
- **Overextended Resources:** Her ambition occasionally leads her to overpromise, leaving her scrambling to meet obligations.

---

### **Plot Hooks**

- **Gossip as a Tool:**  
  Maribel has overheard a key piece of information about Voss's antiques shop or the Mournstead mansion. The party can learn this by gaining her trust or completing a small favor for her.

- **Supply Sabotage:**  
  A shipment intended for her store has gone missing, and she suspects foul play. She offers a reward to the party for its recovery, leading to a larger plot.

- **Hidden Treasure Map:**  
  While cataloging a batch of old wares, Maribel finds a map hinting at a treasure tied to the mansion. She approaches the party, offering to fund their expedition in exchange for a share of the findings.
