# **Ryker "Shadow" Malven, The Local Miscreant**

**Role in Mourn's Folly:**  
Ryker is a known troublemaker who uses their skills for petty theft and the occasional high-stakes heist. With a penchant for slipping through shadows, they've earned the nickname "Shadow" among the townsfolk. Though distrusted by most, their skills make them an invaluable ally in uncovering secrets or retrieving valuables.

**Personality:**  
Clever, opportunistic, and resourceful, Ryker thrives on the thrill of the heist. While they outwardly claim they only care for gold, their actions sometimes betray a desire for recognition and respect from their peers.

**Personality When Turned:**  
As a vampire, Ryker becomes a calculating and cold predator, driven by both bloodlust and a desire for dominance. Their cunning takes on a more sinister edge, and they delight in using fear and shadows to toy with their prey.
