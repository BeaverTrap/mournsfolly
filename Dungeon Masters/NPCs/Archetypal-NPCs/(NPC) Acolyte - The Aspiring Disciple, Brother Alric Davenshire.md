### **Traits**

- **Dark Spellcasting.**  
  Brother Alric retains some of his spellcasting abilities, now twisted by his vampiric nature. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following spells prepared:  
  **Cantrips (at will):** *Thaumaturgy*, *Chill Touch*

  **2nd level (3 slots):** *Hold Person*, *Darkness*  
  **3rd level (2 slots):** *Vampiric Touch*, *Counterspell*

- **Dark Faith.**  
  Brother Alric's former devotion is twisted into a fervent loyalty to Barstow. He exudes a dark aura that grants allies within 10 feet resistance to radiant damage.

- **Regeneration.**  
  Brother Alric regains 10 hit points at the start of his turn unless he is in sunlight or running water.

- **Spider Climb.**  
  Brother Alric can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

- **Sunlight Sensitivity.**  
  While in sunlight, Brother Alric has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks and takes 20 radiant damage at the start of each turn.

### **Actions**

- **Multiattack.**  
  Brother Alric makes two attacks: one with his claws and one with his bite.

- **Claws.**  
  *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
  *Hit:* 9 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage. Instead of dealing damage, Brother Alric can grapple the target (escape DC 15).

- **Bite.**  
  *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled, incapacitated, or restrained.  
  *Hit:* 10 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by the necrotic damage dealt, and Brother Alric regains hit points equal to that amount.

---

### **Reactions**

- **Unholy Protection.**  
  When an ally within 10 feet takes radiant damage, Brother Alric can use his reaction to absorb half the damage, transferring it to himself.
