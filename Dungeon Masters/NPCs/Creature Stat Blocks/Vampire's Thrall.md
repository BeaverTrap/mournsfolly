### **Special Traits**

- **Enthralling Bond:** The Vampire's Thrall is utterly bound to their master's will, enchanted with a powerful charm that imbues them with pleasure in submission. They cannot break free of the charm unless the vampire is destroyed. Upon release, they remember all actions taken under control, often leading to severe emotional trauma.
- **Resistance to Pain:** While charmed by the vampire, the thrall can push through minor wounds with unnatural resilience, gaining resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
- **Drained Vitality:** The thrall has a sickly, pale appearance due to frequent feeding by their vampire master. They have disadvantage on saving throws to resist diseases and poisons, as their constitution is weakened.

### **Actions**

- **Multiattack:** The thrall makes two melee attacks.
- **Unarmed Strike:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
    - _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. The thrall can choose to grapple the target (escape DC 14) instead of dealing damage.
- **Lifeblood Strike:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
    - _Hit:_ 8 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on their next attack roll or ability check due to a temporary loss of vitality.

### **Reactions**

- **Protective Instinct:** If a creature within 5 feet of the thrall targets the vampire it serves, the thrall can impose disadvantage on the attack roll, stepping in harm's way.

### **Behavior and Combat**

- **Dedicated Protector:** The Vampire's Thrall is a willing defender, sacrificing themselves without hesitation to protect their master.
- **Grapple and Disable:** Prefers to grapple or disable threats to their master first, using their unnatural resilience to shield their vampire.
- **Draining Strikes:** Aims to weaken opponents with strikes that sap vitality, softening them for the vampire's arrival.
