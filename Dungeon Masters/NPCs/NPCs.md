title: NPCs

Each **PC Background** in _Mourn’s Folly_ is mirrored by an **Archetypal NPC**, representing the essence of that background in the world. These NPCs serve a dual purpose: providing depth and support as potential allies or driving the narrative forward as corrupted foes under Barstow’s influence.

#### **Interplay Between PCs and NPCs**

When a Player Character selects a background corresponding to an [[Archetypal NPCs]], that NPC **is not used in your campaign.** Their role, backstory, and thematic significance are absorbed into the player’s character, ensuring the background feels deeply personal and integral to their journey.

For **Archetypal NPCs not in use**, you are free to incorporate them into the campaign as allies, sources of lore, or emotionally impactful adversaries. These NPCs are not just minor townsfolk; they can assist the party in meaningful ways or serve as a foil, reflecting what might have been had the PC chosen differently.

These NPCs enrich the setting by:

- Providing local expertise or assistance to the party.
- Acting as emotional anchors through relationships with the PCs or townsfolk.
- Creating moments of moral tension and loss if they fall to Barstow’s influence.

#### **From Ally to Threat: Unique Turned NPCs**

Unused Archetypal NPCs can be turned into vampires under Barstow’s influence, becoming memorable foes for the party. Each NPC has a **turned stat block** and twisted personality, reflecting how Barstow’s corruption warps their original traits and values. This transition creates high emotional stakes, especially if the NPC was once an ally or someone the party relied on.

- **Example:**  
    A noble and selfless **Rupert Niles, Town Librarian**, becomes an unnerving and cunning thrall, using forbidden knowledge and tactics to trap the party.

#### **Using NPCs to Build Narrative Depth**

1. **If the Background is Chosen by a PC:**  
    The corresponding NPC’s story and role become part of the PC’s background, and their unique challenges and connections are absorbed into that player’s character arc. This allows the narrative to center on the player while avoiding redundancy.

2. **If the Background is NOT Chosen:**  
    Archetypal NPCs can:
    
    - Provide aid to the party, such as healing, lore, or combat assistance.
    - Deepen the story by offering a perspective tied to Mourn’s Folly’s history and struggles.
    - Serve as a source of tragedy and dramatic tension if turned, forcing the party to face former allies as enemies.

### Leveraging NPCs for Storytelling

- **Emotional Connections:** Tie NPCs to the players by using past relationships, shared goals, or conflicts. For example, an NPC might have mentored a party member or been a rival in their youth.

- **Unique Threats When Turned:** A turned NPC should not simply be another vampire spawn. Instead, they embody a dark reflection of their former selves, with abilities and personality traits perverted by Barstow’s influence.

- **Foreshadowing the Corruption:** Use subtle hints—odd behavior, unexplained absences, or conflicting accounts of their actions—to show the gradual decline of an NPC if they’re destined to be turned.
