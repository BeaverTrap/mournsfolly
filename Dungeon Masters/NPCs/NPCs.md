Each **PC Background** in _Mourn’s Folly_ is mirrored by an **Archetypal NPC**, representing the essence of that background in the world. These NPCs serve a dual purpose: providing depth and support as potential allies or driving the narrative forward as corrupted foes under Barstow’s influence.

- [[Archetypal NPCs]]
- [[Main NPCs]]

#### **Interplay Between PCs and NPCs**

When a Player Character selects a background corresponding to an [[Archetypal NPCs]], that NPC **is not used in your campaign.** Their role, backstory, and thematic significance are absorbed into the player’s character, ensuring the background feels deeply personal and integral to their journey.

For **Archetypal NPCs not in use**, you are free to incorporate them into the campaign as allies, sources of lore, or emotionally impactful adversaries. These NPCs are not just minor townsfolk; they can assist the party in meaningful ways or serve as a foil, reflecting what might have been had the PC chosen differently.

These NPCs enrich the setting by:

- Providing local expertise or assistance to the party.
- Acting as emotional anchors through relationships with the PCs or townsfolk.
- Creating moments of moral tension and loss if they fall to Barstow’s influence.
