### **Traits**

- **Spellcasting.**  
  Cedric is a 5th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following spells prepared:  

  - **Cantrips (at will):** *Light*, *Sacred Flame*, *Thaumaturgy*  
  - **1st level (4 slots):** *Bless*, *Sanctuary*, *Healing Word*  
  - **2nd level (3 slots):** *Lesser Restoration*, *Spiritual Weapon*  
  - **3rd level (2 slots):** *Daylight*, *Revivify*  

- **Turn Undead (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).**  
  As an action, Cedric can present his holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead within 30 feet that can see or hear him must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.  

- **Crisis of Faith.**  
  If Cedric's health drops below half (23 HP or lower), his spell save DC decreases by 1, and he has disadvantage on saving throws to maintain concentration.  

- **Holy Symbol of Lathander (Trinket).**  

  - **Repel Undead:** As an action, Cedric can present the holy symbol to repel undead within 10 feet. Each undead creature in range must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 1d8 radiant damage and must retreat 10 feet for 1 minute.  
  - **Lathander's Light (1/Day):** Cedric can invoke the symbol to emit a burst of radiant light in a 15-foot radius, casting *Daylight* for 1 minute. Undead within this light have disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws.  
  - **Faith Dependent:** Each use of **Repel Undead** reduces the save DC by 1 for subsequent uses, and undead have advantage on saving throws if Cedric's health is below half.

---

### **Actions**

- **Mace.**  
  *Melee Attack:* +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
  *Hit:* 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage.  

- **Radiant Smite (1/Day).**  
  As a bonus action, Cedric calls upon Lathander's light to infuse his mace, adding 2d8 radiant damage to his next melee attack against an undead creature.

---

### **Reactions**

- **Protective Blessing (1/Day).**  
  *Trigger:* An ally within 30 feet would take damage.  
  *Response:* Cedric grants that ally temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + 3, which last until the start of Cedric's next turn.

## **Father Cedric Halford Backstory**

**Background:**  
Father Cedric Halford has served as the town's priest of Lathander for over two decades, acting as a comforting and guiding figure for the people of *Mourn's Folly*. However, he harbors a quiet, desperate struggle with his faith. Years ago, a tragic series of events shook Cedric's belief in Lathander's light; loved ones were lost to illness and unexplained misfortune, and, despite his prayers, he saw no intervention. This crisis of faith has haunted him since, leaving him plagued by doubts and fearing that he's unworthy of Lathander's blessing.

When his faith faltered, Cedric turned to drink. Most nights, he's found at the back of the local tavern, keeping to himself, his worn fingers wrapped around a flask as he mutters broken prayers to the Dawnkeeper. The townsfolk see his drinking as a response to his burdens, though some now view him as a man who's drifted from his faith. Despite his doubts, Cedric feels a deep obligation to his town, even if his own conviction is brittle.

---

### **Appearance and Personality**

Cedric is in his late fifties, his once-bright robes faded and his golden pendant of Lathander often hidden beneath his tunic. His face, once filled with kindness, now shows a haunted weariness. Though he continues leading morning rituals for the few faithful who remain, he seems heavy with inner conflict, as though each prayer is a battle against his own fears.

---

## **Role in the Story**

- **Skepticism of Barstow and Voss:**  
  Cedric is one of the few who suspects that something unnatural stirs at the mansion. The darkness he senses reminds him of the tragedies that originally shook his faith, bringing a feeling of old fears resurfacing.

- **Reluctant Ally:**  
  Although his spirit is jaded, Cedric's sense of duty to protect the town overrides his reluctance. He can provide the players with lore about Lathander and perhaps artifacts or rituals of protection, though he's filled with self-doubt.

- **Seeking Redemption:**  
  Helping the players confront Barstow's influence may allow Cedric a chance at redemption, letting him face his fears and reconnect with his faith. This struggle could form a moving arc for Cedric, as he rediscovers his purpose and worth through the players' efforts.

---

### **Quotes**

- "I've known that mansion was a bad place my whole life. It was cursed long before Barstow laid his hands on it, I'm sure of it."  
- "They say Lathander's light is for everyone, but... some shadows run deep, don't they?"  
- "Faith is... it's like dawn itself. It has to come from somewhere, doesn't it? But I haven't seen it in a long, long time."

## **Cedric's Struggle and Downfall**

### **Act 1: Guiding Light**  
Cedric takes on a supportive role early on, providing healing, guidance, and insight into the town's superstitions and history. He's a key figure of reassurance, perhaps even assisting the party in minor skirmishes or supernatural encounters. His connection to Lathander's light makes him a symbolic protector against the unknown.

---

### **Act 2: Crisis of Faith**  
As dark occurrences escalate and the threats in Mourn's Folly grow more menacing, Cedric's faith begins to waver. His strength as a healer weakens, and he turns increasingly to his flask for solace, hoping to dull the rising tension. His drinking becomes more evident, affecting his composure and even his judgment. This crisis comes to a head at the act's end when Cedric confronts **Walter Barstow** to shield the party. In this moment, his faltering faith leaves him vulnerable, and Barstow strikes him down, killing Cedric and extinguishing the light he once represented.

---

### **Act 3: Final Battle (Post-Cedric)**  
Cedric's sacrifice intensifies the stakes and serves as a rallying point for the party in the final showdown against Barstow, marking a thematic shift from reliance on external protection to their own resolve and strength.
