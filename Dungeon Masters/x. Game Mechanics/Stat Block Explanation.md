---

This document explains each component of a stat block to help new DMs understand how to use it effectively.

---

### Title
- Description: The name of the creature, followed by its general classification and alignment.  
  Example: `# Ice Golem`  
  Why: The title sets the tone and identifies the creature’s type and alignment, guiding how it interacts with the world.

---

### Stats

- Armor Class (AC): The difficulty of hitting the creature with an attack.  
  Example: `Armor Class: 17 (natural armor)`  
  Why: AC determines how tough a creature is to hit, factoring in physical protection like armor or magical defenses.

- Initiative: Derived from the creature’s Dexterity modifier and determines its position in combat order.  
  Example: `Initiative: -1`  
  Why: Initiative ensures fairness in combat, allowing creatures and players to act in turn.

- Hit Points (HP): The amount of damage the creature can take before being defeated.  
  Example: `Hit Points: 105 (10d10 + 50)`  
  Why: HP reflects the creature’s durability, helping balance encounters.

- Speed: How far the creature can move on its turn, measured in feet.  
  Example: `Speed: 30 ft.`  
  Why: Speed determines how easily the creature can close distances or retreat.

- Ability Scores: Lists the creature’s Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), and Charisma (CHA), along with modifiers and saving throw bonuses.  

| **Ability** | **Score** | **Mod** | **Save** |     | **Ability** | **Score** | **Mod** | **Save** |
| ----------- | --------- | ------- | -------- | --- | ----------- | --------- | ------- | -------- |
| **STR**     | 20        | +5      | +7       |     | **INT**     | 3         | -4      | -4       |
| **DEX**     | 9         | -1      | -1       |     | **WIS**     | 10        | +0      | +2       |
| **CON**     | 20        | +5      | +7       |     | **CHA**     | 1         | -5      | -5       |

  Why: Ability scores govern how the creature interacts with the environment and performs in combat.

### Traits

- Damage Resistances/Immunities: Indicates what types of damage the creature takes reduced or no damage from.  
  Example: `Damage Resistances: Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing from Nonmagical Attacks`  
  Why: These resistances force players to adapt tactics when certain damage types are less effective.

- Condition Immunities: Lists conditions the creature cannot be affected by (e.g., Charmed, Frightened).  
  Example: `Condition Immunities: Charmed, Exhaustion, Frightened, Paralyzed, Petrified, Poisoned`  
  Why: This makes creatures immune to specific crowd control effects, reflecting their design.

- Senses: Defines what the creature can perceive, including special senses like Darkvision or Tremorsense.  
  Example: `Senses: Darkvision 60 ft., Passive Perception 10`  
  Why: Senses dictate how aware the creature is of its surroundings, crucial for setting up ambushes or detecting hidden players.

- Languages: Lists what languages the creature understands or speaks.  
  Example: `Languages: Understands Sylvan but cannot speak`  
  Why: Languages add narrative depth and allow communication with the players if relevant.

- Challenge (CR): The difficulty level of the creature, used to calculate XP rewards.  
  Example: `Challenge: 6 (2,300 XP)`  
  Why: CR helps balance encounters based on the party’s strength.

- Proficiency Bonus (PB): A standardized bonus used for attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws.  
  Example: `Proficiency Bonus: +3`  
  Why: Consistency in bonuses ensures the creature’s mechanics are balanced.

### Special Traits

- Description: Special abilities that make the creature unique.  
  Example:  
  Constructed Resilience: The Ice Golem does not require air, food, drink, or sleep.  
  Why: Traits define a creature’s strengths, weaknesses, or role in combat and the narrative.

---

### Actions

- Multiattack: Indicates how many attacks the creature can make on its turn.  
  Example: `Multiattack: The Ice Golem makes two Slam attacks.`  
  Why: Multiattack increases damage output, making creatures more dangerous.

- Recharge Abilities: Abilities that can only be used after a recharge roll.  
  Example: `Freezing Stomp (Recharge 5–6): The Ice Golem stomps the ground, releasing a freezing shockwave.`  
  Why: Recharge abilities add unpredictability, forcing players to adapt.

- Basic Attacks: Melee or ranged attacks with stats for hit chance and damage.  
  Example:  
  Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  
  Hit: 15 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 5 (1d10) cold damage.  
  Why: These actions define how the creature deals damage in combat.

---

### Behavior and Combat

- Description: Explains how the creature behaves and its tactics.  
  Example:  
  Combat Preferences: The Ice Golem focuses on defending the frost barrier and prioritizes targets actively attacking the structure.  
  Why: Behavior guides the DM in roleplaying the creature effectively.

---

### Description

- Appearance: Visual and narrative flavor for the creature.  
  Example:  
  Appearance: A towering construct of jagged, translucent ice with glowing runes etched across its surface.  
  Why: Adds immersion and makes encounters more memorable.
