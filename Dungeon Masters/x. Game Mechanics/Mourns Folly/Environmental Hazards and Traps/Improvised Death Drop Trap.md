title: Improvised Death Drop Trap
---

**Deadly Trap** *(Effective for levels 8â€“12)*

This trap is deceptively disguised as a normal staircase, luring unsuspecting victims downward. After the first few steps, the staircase abruptly ends, dropping off into a deadly pit lined with makeshift weapons embedded in broken floorboards below. Knives with shattered handles, jagged glass, rusted tools, and other sharp objects are angled to pierce or maim anyone who falls. Shadows from above obscure the gap, making it hard to spot without a thorough inspection.

### Trigger

Any creature descending the staircase without checking it or using a light source may trigger the trap.

### Effect

The triggering creature must make a **DC 15 Dexterity saving throw**. 

- **Success**: They catch themselves at the edge, realizing the danger in time.
- **Failure**: They fall, taking **2d6 bludgeoning damage** from the drop and an additional **3d6 piercing damage** from the crude, sharp objects below. 

Additionally, the creature must make a **DC 13 Constitution saving throw** to avoid infection from the rust and grime on the makeshift weapons. On a failure, they suffer the **poisoned condition** for 1 hour.

### Countermeasures

- A **DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check** reveals slight irregularities on the staircase and faint glints of metal and glass below.
- Using darkvision or a bright light reduces the **Perception check** DC to 10, making it easier to spot the dangerous gap and the sharpened objects below.

### Bypassing the Trap

- **Rope Descent**: A character can secure a rope to a sturdy fixture and carefully lower themselves past the missing steps. This requires a **DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check** to descend without slipping.

### Psychological Impact

The improvised, vicious nature of this trap suggests a twisted mind at work, its intent not just to kill but to maim and terrify. For players, the disturbing setup foreshadows a ruthless enemy lurking below, waiting to strike when they're at their most vulnerable.

### Leaving the Cellar

Once in the cellar, returning to the top of the staircase is just as challenging.

- **Careful Ascent**: Climbing back up the rope (if used) requires a **Strength (Athletics) check** DC 10. Characters ascending should remain quiet to avoid disturbing any vampires still in the cellar.
- **Removing the Trap Components**: To avoid future encounters with the trap, players at the bottom can carefully dismantle the spike planks.
