---

Sunlight is one of the most potent and feared weaknesses of vampires, serving as both a weapon and a strategic advantage for those who confront them.

---

### **1. Sunlight Hypersensitivity**  

- **Effect:** Sunlight is toxic to vampires, causing intense physical harm.  
- **Mechanics:**  
  - Vampires take **20 radiant damage** at the start of each turn in direct sunlight.  
  - Prolonged exposure is deadly, quickly depleting their hit points.  

---

### **2. Disadvantage on Attacks and Ability Checks**  

- **Effect:** Sunlight blinds and weakens vampires, disrupting their focus and precision.  
- **Mechanics:**  
  - Vampires in sunlight suffer **disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability checks**.  
  - This significantly reduces their combat effectiveness.  

---

### **3. Immobilizing Vampire Regeneration**  

- **Effect:** Vampires cannot heal while exposed to sunlight.  
- **Mechanics:**  
  - Sunlight disables a vampire's **Regeneration** trait until it leaves the sun's rays.  
  - This makes sunlight critical for preventing vampires from recovering damage.  

---

### **4. Limiting Escape and Movement**  

- **Effect:** Sunlight restricts a vampire's ability to flee or take cover.  
- **Mechanics:**  
  - Vampires instinctively avoid sunlight, making it useful for cornering or trapping them.  
  - Sunlight may block abilities like **Spider Climb** and **Misty Escape**, reducing their mobility.  

---

### **5. Weakening Charisma-Based Abilities**  

- **Effect:** Sunlight reduces a vampire's aura of intimidation and charm.  
- **Mechanics:**  
  - Vampires lose access to abilities like **Charm** and **Children of the Night** while in sunlight.  
  - This prevents them from influencing allies or summoning minions.  

---

### **6. Vulnerability When Grappled or Restrained in Sunlight**  

- **Effect:** Forcing a vampire to remain in sunlight is a powerful tactic.  
- **Mechanics:**  
  - Grappled or restrained vampires take continuous **20 radiant damage** per turn in sunlight.  
  - This immobilization, combined with other methods, can neutralize or destroy them.  

---

### **Tactical Advantage**  

Sunlight is an invaluable tool for confronting vampires, stripping away their regenerative abilities, reducing their combat effectiveness, and dealing significant damage. Players can use it creatively to trap, weaken, or destroy vampires in a variety of scenarios.
