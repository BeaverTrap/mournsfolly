Each house has a [Vampire's Thrall]

### Nest Occupants

Each house has a **[Vampire's Thrall](../../../../Mourn's-Folly/NPCs/Creature-Stat-Blocks/Vampire's-Thrall)** and a varying number of [Feral Vampire Spawn](../../../../Mourn's-Folly/NPCs/Creature-Stat-Blocks/Feral-Vampire-Spawn) in the cellar.

- **Feral Vampire Count**: Roll a d4 to determine how many Feral Vampires inhabit the cellar.
  - **Result 1-4**: This is the number of Feral Vampires found in the cellar, lying dormant during the day.

## Layout

### Ground Floor
The ground floor is modest, reflecting the humble lifestyle of Mourn's Folly residents. Rooms are small and practical, arranged with simplicity in mind. Faded wallpaper and sturdy but worn wooden furniture fill each space. The atmosphere feels lived-in but aged, with each room connected by narrow doorways.

- **Living Room**: The central area with a worn sofa and chairs surrounding a low table. A small fireplace crackles with embers or sits cold and unused. Family trinkets or heirlooms—photographs, an old quilt, a cracked mirror—give the room a touch of personality.
- **Kitchen**: A compact kitchen with a small wooden table for eating, rough stone countertops, and modest cooking supplies. Some houses have hanging herbs or small dried bouquets, remnants of the town's traditional values.
- **Back Pantry**: Next to the kitchen, this small pantry holds jars of preserved food, dried meats, and simple supplies. If the house has a stairway to the cellar, it typically leads down from here.
- **Bedrooms**: Two small bedrooms, each with a single bed, a tiny wardrobe, and maybe a cracked mirror on the wall. Clothes and bedding are minimal. Personal belongings such as books or trinkets often reflect the individual's personality.

### Cellar
The cellar is unlit and damp, holding a chill even during the day. A narrow, creaky wooden staircase leads down from the pantry, but the first few steps have been carefully removed. Knives, swords, and other sharpened tools have been crudely hammered blade-up into the planks below, their hilts removed, creating a lethal trap for the unwary. Anyone descending without caution would face a deadly fall onto the upturned blades.

- **Improvised Death Drop Trap**: [[Learn more about this trap]]
- **Cellar Contents**:
  - Basic shelves with storage jars, wine bottles, and small crates of potatoes or other root vegetables.
  - A dirt floor, often uneven and slightly damp.
  - Scattered hay or old cloth on the floor where feral vampires rest during the day, often covered to blend in and hide them from view.
  - Painted or etched symbols on the walls, meant to bolster the vampires' presence and claim the cellar as forbidden ground.

### Feral Vampire Gathering

By Act Three, these cellars are home to multiple feral vampires, doubling up or huddling in groups to avoid the sunlight above. These creatures will typically attack intruders but may hide if severely weakened.
