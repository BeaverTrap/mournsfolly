## Confrontation in the Cellar

The PCs slip into Mournstead Mansion, navigating the darkened halls until they find the stairs leading to the cellar. Descending carefully, they spot faint candlelight flickering below and hear low, murmured words. As they peek into the room, they witness Voss in the midst of a dark ritual, his eyes fixed on the crate and the now-entranced delivery men.

A low, throaty whisper fills the air as the crate slowly creaks open, revealing the pale, monstrous figure of Walter Barstow. Barstow's gaze locks onto the PCs, his eyes gleaming with sudden fury at the disruption. With a sinister grin, Voss turns, his demeanor shifting from ritualistic calm to cold malice.

### Battle in the Cellar

- **Fight Initiation:**  
  Voss, realizing the ritual has been interrupted, attacks the PCs in an attempt to eliminate or drive them away. He fights with desperate ferocity, determined to keep them from interfering further.

- **Barstow's Escape:**  
  Barstow, momentarily weakened from his slumber, lets out a guttural hiss and launches himself toward the mansion's exit. His vampiric form is quick and silent, slipping past the PCs and up the stairs with unnerving speed.

  > Barstow's only refuge now is to take over a house within one of the neighborhoods.

## Consequences of the Confrontation

- **If Voss Survives:**  
  After Barstow's escape, Voss becomes a dangerous enemy, deeply committed to restoring his master's hold on the town. He works behind the scenes, using his connections and charm to rally support among the townsfolk and protect Barstow.

- **If Voss Dies:**  
  Without Voss, Barstow lacks a key ally for his takeover of the town. Instead of creating thralls, he begins a vicious assault, unleashing only [Feral Vampire Spawn](../../../../Mourn's-Folly/NPCs/Creature-Stat-Blocks/Feral-Vampire-Spawn).

- **Barstow's Safe Haven:**  
  Fleeing to the antique shop, Barstow is forced to operate from within its confines. This limits his influence, giving the PCs time to rally support and investigate further.
