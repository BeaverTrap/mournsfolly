title: Act 3 - The Revelation and Showdown
---


**Overview:**  
The PCs uncover the full scope of the unnatural events plaguing Mourn’s Folly. Marlon Voss’s charming facade crumbles, and Walter Barstow reveals his true, terrifying nature. The mansion thrums with malevolent energy, and Barstow’s influence escalates, targeting townsfolk or a vulnerable NPC, such as Father Cedric, as a dire warning.

### Key Moments:

- **Showdown in the Mansion or Shop:**  
  The PCs confront Barstow and Voss, relying on the clues they've gathered to counter the supernatural threat. The setting itself may shift, with objects moving unnaturally or oppressive shadows aiding Barstow.

- **Cedric's Fall or Sacrifice:**  
  Father Cedric, in a dramatic attempt to resist Barstow’s power, fails or sacrifices himself to protect the PCs, leaving an emotional weight to the battle.

- **Final Battle or Resolution:**  
  The PCs must use their abilities and strategies to either defeat Barstow outright or trap him, neutralizing the vampiric threat. The final moments should challenge them both tactically and narratively.

### Goals:

- Deliver a climactic and intense encounter that tests the PCs’ skills and ingenuity.
- Resolve the central mystery with a high-stakes confrontation that leaves room for creative solutions.
- Conclude with the town's reaction:
  - If Barstow is defeated, the town begins to heal but remains wary of the supernatural.
  - If the PCs fail, Mourn’s Folly succumbs to Barstow’s growing influence, setting the stage for future conflicts.
