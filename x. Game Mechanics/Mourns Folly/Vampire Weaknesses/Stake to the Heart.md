title: Stake to the Heart
---

---

A stake through the heart is a classic and powerful method for neutralizing vampires, forcing them into a helpless state or destroying them outright.

---

### **1. Immobilizing a Vampire**  

- **Effect:** Driving a wooden stake through a vampire's heart instantly **paralyzes** it, rendering it incapacitated and unable to act.  
- **Mechanics:**  
  - The vampire must be **incapacitated, restrained, or unconscious** to successfully stake it.  
  - Requires an **action** and a **melee attack** with a wooden stake.  
  - On a hit, the vampire becomes **paralyzed** until the stake is removed.

### **2. Instant Destruction (Optional for Feral and Lesser Vampires)**  

- **Effect:** For certain vampires (e.g., lesser or feral types), staking can destroy them outright.  
- **Mechanics:**  
  - A successful melee attack with a stake can **reduce the vampire to ash and bones**, instantly destroying it.  
  - This effect does not apply to more powerful vampires, such as vampire lords, who instead become paralyzed.

### **3. Preventing Regeneration**  

- **Effect:** While a stake remains lodged in a vampire's heart, it cannot regenerate or recover hit points.  
- **Mechanics:**  
  - The vampire remains paralyzed and **unable to regenerate** as long as the stake is in place.  
  - This ensures the vampire cannot recover or regain strength during or after the encounter.

### **4. Symbol of Finality and Vulnerability**  

- **Effect:** For powerful vampires, staking renders them helpless but does not destroy them outright, leaving them vulnerable to permanent destruction by other means.  
- **Mechanics:**  
  - A vampire lord, if staked, becomes helpless but remains alive.  
  - Secondary actions like **exposure to sunlight**, **fire**, or **decapitation** are required for a permanent end.

### **Tactical Importance**  

The stake to the heart is a decisive tactic, emphasizing the vampire's vulnerabilities and mortality. While powerful for neutralizing a vampire, it often requires coordination, preparation, and follow-through to ensure the creature does not return.
