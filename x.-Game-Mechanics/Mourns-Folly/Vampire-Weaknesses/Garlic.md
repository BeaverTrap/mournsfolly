### **Garlic Garland Effect on Vampires**  

- **Effect:** Vampires are instinctively repelled by the overwhelming scent of garlic and are hesitant to bite any character wearing a garlic garland.  
- **Mechanics:**  
  - A vampire attempting to bite the wearer must make a **Wisdom saving throw (DC 13)**. On a failure, the vampire cannot complete the bite, losing that attack.  
  - On a success, the vampire overcomes its aversion and can proceed as normal.  
- **Duration:** The garlic garland remains effective for **1d4 hours**, after which the scent fades, rendering it ineffective.  
- **Fragility:** If the garlic garland is destroyed (e.g., torn or crushed), its effects fade within a few minutes as the remaining scent dissipates.
