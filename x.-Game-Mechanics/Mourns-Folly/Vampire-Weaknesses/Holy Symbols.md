**Holy symbols** are potent tools against vampires, leveraging divine power and faith to ward off or harm undead creatures. Here's a breakdown of how holy symbols affect vampires:

---

### **Holy Symbols as Repellents**  

- **Effect:** Holy symbols can deter vampires, forcing them to keep their distance if wielded with genuine faith and conviction.  
- **Mechanics:**  
  - A character holding a holy symbol and channeling their faith forces vampires within **10 feet** to make a **Wisdom saving throw** (DC 13 or higher if blessed).  
  - On a failure, the vampire must retreat and cannot willingly approach within 10 feet for **1 minute**.  
  - On a success, the vampire resists the repellent effect but may hesitate to attack directly.

### **Infusing Weapons with Radiant Damage**  

- **Effect:** A holy symbol can bless weapons, granting them the power to deal extra **radiant damage** to undead.  
- **Mechanics:**  
  - By using a holy symbol to bless a weapon (requiring a spell or ritual), the weapon gains an additional **1d4 radiant damage** against vampires for **1 hour** or until the blessing fades.  
  - Some spells, such as *Divine Smite*, can channel radiant power through a holy symbol to amplify attacks.

### **Disrupting Regeneration**  

- **Effect:** Holy symbols can interrupt a vampire's regenerative abilities.  
- **Mechanics:**  
  - If a vampire is struck by a weapon blessed with a holy symbol or injured in the presence of a holy symbol, its **Regeneration** trait is disabled until the start of its next turn.

### **Turning Undead**  

- **Effect:** Clerics and other holy warriors can use holy symbols to "Turn" undead creatures, including vampires.  
- **Mechanics:**  
  - Using a holy symbol, a cleric may cast *Turn Undead*, forcing vampires within **30 feet** to make a **Wisdom saving throw**.  
  - On a failure, the vampire is compelled to **flee** for **1 minute** (or until harmed).  
  - Higher-level clerics may also **Destroy Undead** if they succeed with a more powerful turn.  

---

### **Blessing Entrances and Boundaries**  

- **Effect:** Placing holy symbols near doors, windows, or entrances can create a barrier against vampires.  
- **Mechanics:**  
  - A holy symbol placed at a threshold requires a vampire to succeed on a **Charisma saving throw** to cross.  
  - On a failure, the vampire cannot enter the protected space, establishing it as a sanctuary.

Holy symbols, when combined with strong faith or clerical power, serve as critical safeguards against vampires, exploiting their vulnerability to divine and sacred forces while providing strategic advantages for players.
