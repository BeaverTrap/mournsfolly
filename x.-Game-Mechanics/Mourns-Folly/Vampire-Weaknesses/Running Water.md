- **Effect:** Running water slows and harms vampires, deterring movement.  
- **Mechanics:**  
  - Vampires treat running water as **difficult terrain**, doubling their movement cost.

### **Weakening Regenerative Abilities**  

- **Effect:** Running water halts a vampire's **Regeneration**.  
- **Mechanics:**  
  - While in contact with running water, a vampire's regenerative abilities are disabled, leaving them vulnerable to sustained damage.

### **Restricting Vampire Tactics and Abilities**  

- **Effect:** Running water disrupts certain vampire abilities.  
- **Mechanics:**  
  - Vampires lose access to abilities like **Spider Climb** or **Misty Escape** when forced into running water.

### **Symbolic Protection for Residences**  

- **Effect:** Running water is a natural defense against vampires, often safeguarding sanctuaries.

### **Folklore and Symbolism**  

In folklore, running water is seen as a cleansing and purifying force, directly opposing the stagnation of undead creatures. Rivers and streams are symbols of life and renewal, which disrupt a vampire's unnatural essence. This aversion aligns with D&D mechanics, where running water deals acid damage, symbolizing its power to erode a vampire's lifeforce.  

Running water's danger to vampires adds complexity to encounters, providing players with natural defenses and tactical opportunities to exploit this weakness.
