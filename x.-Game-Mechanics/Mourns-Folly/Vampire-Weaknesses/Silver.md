### **1. Enhanced Damage from Silvered Weapons**  

- **Effect:** Silvered weapons cut through a vampire's defenses, inflicting greater harm.  
- **Mechanics:**  
  - Vampires take an additional **1d4 radiant damage** per hit from silvered weapons.  
  - Silver's purity disrupts their dark essence, making it harder for vampires to withstand attacks.  

---

### **2. Blocking Regeneration**  

- **Effect:** Silver interferes with a vampire's natural healing abilities.  
- **Mechanics:**  
  - Any damage from a silvered weapon prevents a vampire's **Regeneration** trait until the start of its next turn.  
  - Sustained attacks with silvered weapons continuously block regeneration.  

---

### **3. Inhibiting Shapechanging Abilities**  

- **Effect:** Silver disrupts a vampire's ability to transform.  
- **Mechanics:**  
  - Vampires attempting to shapeshift while in contact with silver must succeed on a **DC 15 Constitution saving throw** or fail to transform.  
  - Vampires already transformed revert to their true form if they fail the saving throw.

### **4. Silver Dust as a Protective Barrier**  

- **Effect:** A line of silver dust creates a ward against vampires.  
- **Mechanics:**  
  - Vampires cannot cross a line of powdered silver without first disrupting or dispelling it.  
  - This barrier is fragile and can be disturbed by environmental factors, like wind or water.  

---

### **5. Weakening Vampire Charms**  

- **Effect:** The presence of silver disrupts a vampire's charm effects.  
- **Mechanics:**  
  - Characters carrying a silver charm or amulet cause vampires targeting them with charm effects to make a **DC 15 Wisdom saving throw**.  
  - On a failure, the charm effect does not take hold, and the vampire cannot target the character with charm abilities for **24 hours**.  

---

### **6. Searing Pain When Touched by Silver**  

- **Effect:** Direct contact with silver inflicts pain and radiant damage on vampires.  
- **Mechanics:**  
  - A vampire touching or being touched by silver takes **1d6 radiant damage** per turn of contact.  
  - This discourages direct grappling or handling of silver by vampires.
