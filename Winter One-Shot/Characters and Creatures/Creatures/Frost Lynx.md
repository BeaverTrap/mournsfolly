### **Traits**

- **Pounce**:  
  If the Frost Lynx moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a **DC 13 Strength saving throw** or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the Frost Lynx can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.

- **Snow Camouflage**:  
  The Frost Lynx has advantage on Stealth checks made to hide in snowy terrain.
