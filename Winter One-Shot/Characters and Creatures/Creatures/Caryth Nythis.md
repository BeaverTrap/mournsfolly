### **Appearance and Background**

- **Appearance:** Caryth Nythis is a hauntingly beautiful fey with alabaster skin and flowing silver hair that moves as though caught in an unseen wind. Her presence exudes both elegance and malice.  

### **Background and Motivations**

#### **Origins**

Caryth Nythis was once a noble of the Feywild, a courtier in a court of eternal twilight and crystalline beauty. She held a position of power among her peers, celebrated for her ability to weave emotions into magic, crafting wondrous works from the joy, sorrow, and dreams of mortals. Caryth’s specialty was the ability to harvest and channel emotions from mortals without causing harm—a skill that brought her both envy and adoration.

However, Caryth’s ascent to prominence drew rivals, both within the Feywild and the mortal plane. A betrayal by those closest to her—a lover and a fellow courtier—led to her exile. Accused of manipulating emotions for personal gain, she was cast out from the twilight court, left to wander the cold, desolate edges of the Feywild where her powers began to twist.

#### **Transformation into the Ice Sovereign**

In her exile, Caryth’s grief and rage transformed her. She no longer harvested emotions with care; instead, she drained them entirely, feeding on the essence of mortals and corrupting their joy into despair. Her icy domain began to expand as she grew in power, fueled by stolen innocence and the fear of those she left in her wake.

Her once-delicate artistry turned to dark mimicry—where she once shaped dreams, she now forged nightmares. Her icy constructs, like the Hollow Shards, are twisted reflections of the mortals she has consumed, animated by the emotions she feeds upon.

---

#### **Motivations**

1. **Feeding on Innocence**
    
    - Caryth believes that innocence and unguarded emotions are the most potent sources of magic. Children, uncorrupted by life’s burdens, are her ideal prey. By feeding on their joy and hope, she amplifies her own powers and sustains her icy dominion.

2. **Vengeance Against Mortals**
    
    - Caryth blames mortals for her exile, believing they corrupted her peers and turned the Feywild court against her. Each village she targets represents another blow against those she views as inherently flawed and manipulative.

3. **Rebuilding a Court of Her Own**
    
    - Caryth seeks to recreate a court in her own image, using children as the foundation. Her icy constructs and thralls are twisted attempts to replace the companions she lost, though they are hollow echoes of her former life.

---

#### **Methods of Feeding**

1. **Draining Emotions**: Caryth begins by luring children with illusions or fey magic, coaxing them into a state of pure joy or fear before draining their essence.

2. **Freezing in Stasis**: She traps her victims in ice, drawing power from their frozen dreams and unspoken fears. The children remain alive but are locked in an eternal moment of vulnerability.

3. **Constructs of Despair**: Those whose innocence is fully consumed are transformed into her Hollow Shards or other icy constructs, forever bound to her will.

#### **Connections to Brekenford**

- Caryth’s appearance in Brekenford coincides with a surge of unusual weather patterns and local legends of children disappearing during harsh winters.

- The Frostlight Eve festival, where villagers celebrate surviving the winter, is a stark contrast to Caryth’s belief that despair is the natural state of mortals. She seeks to extinguish their fleeting joy as a personal affront to her power.

- Clues in the village, such as eerie frost patterns and frozen effigies near the Shrine of Solstice, suggest her presence long before her full manifestation.
