- **Heat Wave (Recharge 5–6):**  
  The Grimstone Sentinel releases a burst of intense heat in a 15-foot radius.

Creatures wearing metal armor or holding metal objects have disadvantage on the saving throw.

### Behavior and Combat

- **Combat Preferences:** The Grimstone Sentinel focuses on defending the gate and preventing entry. It prioritizes the most direct threat or the creature attempting to bypass the gate.  
- **Weaknesses:** Vulnerable to cold or water-based effects that dampen its heat, reducing its Burning Aura damage by half if affected.

### Appearance and Background

- **Appearance:** A towering construct of deep black stone laced with glowing orange veins of treated Emberstone. Its body radiates intense heat, and its movements are deliberate and precise, accompanied by the sound of crackling flames. 

- **Background:** Created by a secretive order, the Grimstone Sentinel was designed to protect Grimhold from unworthy intruders, harnessing Emberstone’s properties to counter frost-based threats and enforce the order's isolation.
