### **Special Traits**

- **Swarm Form:**  
  The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa. It can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny construct. The swarm cannot regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.  

- **Explosive Death:**  
  When any Spark in the Swarm is destroyed, it releases a fiery burst. All creatures within a 5-foot radius must make a **Dexterity saving throw (DC 12)**, taking **1d6 fire damage** on a failed save or half as much on a success.

---

### **Actions**

- **Swarm Slash:**  
  The Swarm of Emberstone Sparks coordinates multiple **Blazing Slash** attacks from its Sparks.  
  _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., up to three attacks, which can target one creature or be divided among up to three creatures in the Swarm’s space.  
  _Hit:_ Each attack deals **4 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage**, plus an additional **1 fire damage** from the heat of the Sparks.

- **Swarm Charge (Recharge 5–6):**  
  The Swarm of Emberstone Sparks channels a surge of energy through its collective Sparks to amplify a single attack.  
  _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
  _Hit:_ The target takes **14 (4d6 + 2) slashing damage**, and an additional **5 (1d10) fire damage** from the amplified heat of the Sparks.

### **Behavior and Combat**

- **Combat Preferences:**  
  Swarms move as a single unit, focusing on clustered enemies to maximize damage. They aim to trap foes in tight spaces, using **Explosive Death** to cause chaos.  
- **Weaknesses:**  
  While more durable than single Sparks, Swarms remain vulnerable to high-damage area effects.

### **Lair Actions**

On **initiative count 20** (losing ties), the Emberstone Spark lair can: 

- **Release a Swarm:** Deploy **1 Swarm of Emberstone Sparks** into the battlefield. The Swarm acts on its own initiative.

**Appearance and Background**

Emberstone Sparks are small, disk-shaped constructs made entirely of **treated Emberstone,** a black material with sharp, jagged edges and vivid orange veins. When active, the Sparks emit a low mechanical hum, and their edges radiate intense heat, enough to sear through metal or flesh. Dormant Sparks appear inert and cold, resting in storage until activated.

Emberstone Sparks were engineered as autonomous defensive constructs by artificers who sought to weaponize treated Emberstone. Their simple design allows them to act as expendable guardians, activated only when intruders are detected. Each Spark contains a compact, stable Emberstone core that powers its hovering movement and searing attacks. Though straightforward in their purpose, they are infamous for their volatile nature, as their **Explosive Death** trait can quickly turn an intruder's advantage into chaos.

Many Emberstone Sparks are found guarding ancient ruins, dungeons, and vaults constructed with Emberstone. Their design has persisted over centuries due to their effectiveness, and modern engineers continue to replicate and deploy them in locations where deterrence is more critical than subtlety. These constructs are feared for their ability to swarm enemies, harass with precision, and cause devastating chain reactions when destroyed.
