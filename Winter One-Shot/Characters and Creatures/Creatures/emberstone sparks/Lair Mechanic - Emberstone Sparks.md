The Emberstone Spark Lair is a defensive containment system designed to store and deploy Sparks in response to intruders. When activated, the lair releases Sparks in waves, using its mechanisms to overwhelm and disorient invaders.

### **Lair Features**

1. **Storage Function:**
    
    - The lair holds inactive Emberstone Sparks in vents, trapdoors, or concealed chambers.
    - Sparks remain inert until triggered by an intrusion or a manual activation.

2. **Release Mechanism:**
    
    - When activated, the lair releases Sparks as **single units** or **Swarms (1d4+1 Sparks)** into the battlefield.
    - These Sparks act as reinforcements and follow their own initiative.

3. **Destructible Elements:**
    
    - The release points (vents, trapdoors, or magical conduits) can be targeted by players to disrupt reinforcements:
        - **AC:** 12
        - **Hit Points:** 10 per release point
        - **Immunities:** Psychic, Poison, and Radiant damage
    - Destroying a release point prevents Sparks from deploying through that location.

4. **Overload Mechanism:**
    
    - If players **force open** the lair’s containment system, all remaining Sparks are activated simultaneously and enter combat immediately.
    - Opening the system this way damages a large portion of the lair and risks additional environmental hazards.

### **Lair Actions**

On **initiative count 20** (losing ties), the lair takes one of the following actions:

1. **Release Sparks:**
    
    - The lair releases **1d4 Emberstone Sparks** or **1 Swarm of Emberstone Sparks** through its release points.
    - These Sparks enter combat immediately and act on their own initiative.

2. **Energy Surge (Optional):**
    
    - The lair channels ambient energy to temporarily empower active Sparks. Until the start of the next round:
        - All active Sparks gain **+1 to attack rolls** and deal **an additional 1 fire damage** on a successful hit.

### **Using the Lair in Play**

1. **Dynamic Encounters:**
    
    - The lair’s mechanics create a dynamic battlefield, with constant reinforcements keeping players under pressure.
    - Sparks and Swarms act as both combatants and environmental hazards due to their **Explosive Death** trait.

2. **Tactical Objectives:**
    
    - Players can disrupt Spark reinforcements by targeting and destroying release points.
    - Disabling the lair through environmental interaction creates a layered, strategic challenge.

3. **Risk of Overload:**
    
    - Players must weigh the risk of opening the containment system wide, as doing so activates all remaining Sparks simultaneously.
    - This creates a climactic, high-stakes moment in the encounter.

4. **Environmental Hazard:**
    
    - If the lair becomes unstable (e.g., due to overload or sabotage), additional hazards like collapsing vents, surges of fire, or structural damage may occur.
