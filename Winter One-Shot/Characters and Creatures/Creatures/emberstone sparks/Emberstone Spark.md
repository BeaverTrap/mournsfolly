### **Behavior and Combat**

- **Combat Preferences:**  
  Emberstone Sparks swarm around enemies, prioritizing weaker targets. They focus on causing disruption and using **Explosive Death** to damage clustered foes. 
   
- **Weaknesses:**  
  Emberstone Sparks are highly fragile, relying on numbers to overwhelm rather than durability.

### **Lair Actions**

On **initiative count 20** (losing ties), the Emberstone Spark lair can:

- **Release Additional Sparks:** Deploy a **single unit** or **1d4 units** Emberstone Sparks into the battlefield. These Sparks act on their own initiative.

**Appearance and Background**

Emberstone Sparks are small, disk-shaped constructs made entirely of **treated Emberstone,** a black material with sharp, jagged edges and vivid orange veins. When active, the Sparks emit a low mechanical hum, and their edges radiate intense heat, enough to sear through metal or flesh. Dormant Sparks appear inert and cold, resting in storage until activated.

Emberstone Sparks were engineered as autonomous defensive constructs by artificers who sought to weaponize treated Emberstone. Their simple design allows them to act as expendable guardians, activated only when intruders are detected. Each Spark contains a compact, stable Emberstone core that powers its hovering movement and searing attacks. Though straightforward in their purpose, they are infamous for their volatile nature, as their **Explosive Death** trait can quickly turn an intruder's advantage into chaos.

Many Emberstone Sparks are found guarding ancient ruins, dungeons, and vaults constructed with Emberstone. Their design has persisted over centuries due to their effectiveness, and modern engineers continue to replicate and deploy them in locations where deterrence is more critical than subtlety. These constructs are feared for their ability to swarm enemies, harass with precision, and cause devastating chain reactions when destroyed.
