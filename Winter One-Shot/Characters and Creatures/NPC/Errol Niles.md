- **Appearance:** A wiry man in his early 30s, Errol has tousled brown hair and a perpetual look of nervous concentration. He wears simple but sturdy clothing, often layered for the harsh Brakenford winters. His satchel is filled with maps, journals, and annotated texts.

- **Winter One-Shot:** Errol’s connection to Karen Haywood and the village’s children drives him to help, even if it means stepping far outside his comfort zone.

#### **Childhood**

Errol grew up in awe of his older stepbrother, [[NPC The Town's Librarian - Rupert Niles|Rupert]]. While Rupert was bold and fearless, Errol was shy and introspective, preferring the safety of books and stories to the unknowns of the outside world. Rupert, despite his rebellious streak, was protective of Errol, encouraging him to explore his academic talents. “You’ve got the brains, kid,” Rupert would often say with a grin, “but you gotta come out and use that in the real world sometime.” These words stuck with Errol, inspiring him to not only excel in his studies but also to begin considering how his intellect could have practical applications.

#### **Teenage Years**

As [[NPC The Town's Librarian - Rupert Niles|Rupert]]’s rebellious streak intensified, Errol remained the family’s quiet center. He dedicated himself to academics, diving into history, maps, and anything he could learn about the world. Rupert’s influence, though sometimes teasing, pushed him to step outside his comfort zone. Errol began to see the value in using his intellect to make tangible contributions, though he remained hesitant to take risks. Their dynamic—Rupert as the bold trailblazer and Errol as the cautious thinker—deepened their bond, each complementing the other’s strengths.

#### **Young Adulthood**

In his twenties, Errol traveled extensively, using the river trade routes common in the region to explore and study. He rented small rooms aboard trading vessels, spending his time surrounded by books and Order-related materials. These journeys exposed him to various landscapes and fragments of lore, sharpening his skills as a researcher and historian for the **Order of Veiled Truths**.

At age 34, Errol was assigned to [[Brakenford]], a newer settlement in the Shattered Basin, to study the [[Silvermaw Peaks]] and the region’s poorly documented dungeons, caves, and creatures. However, it was not just the Order’s mission that kept him there. He developed a deep bond with [[Karen Haywood]], the village’s young teacher, whose intellect and compassion inspired him. Though Errol fell in love with Karen, he refrains from acting on his feelings, believing the age gap to be inappropriate and instead focusing on supporting her and the community.

Errol eventually requested a transfer within the Order to remain in [[Brakenford]] permanently. He saw the area’s lack of comprehensive knowledge as an opportunity to contribute something meaningful and unique to the Order’s mission.

#### **Present Day**

At 36, Errol balances his duties to the Order with his commitment to [[Brakenford]]. His connection to Karen and the children she teaches is at the core of his dedication to the village. When [[Caryth Nythis]] threatens Brakenford, Errol’s loyalty to the community and his academic rigor compel him to act, despite his natural hesitations. His admiration for [[NPC The Town's Librarian - Rupert Niles|Rupert]] continues to influence him, as he strives to live up to the high standards his brother set for courage and intellect.
