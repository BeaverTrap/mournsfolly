- The mines themselves are not directly in Brekenford but are located within a few hours to a day’s travel from the village. These mines are scattered across the Shattered Basin, taking advantage of natural deposits of iron, tin, and other valuable minerals.
- **Key Locations**:
    - **Ironfang Quarry**: A medium-sized iron mine northeast of the village.
    - **Stonetide Veins**: A smaller tin and copper mining site near the Basin’s edge.
    - **Coldspire Cleft**: A recently discovered cave rumored to contain rare magical crystals, drawing the interest of adventurers and traders alike.

Brekenford acts as a **logistical base and respite** for miners, providing:

- **Accommodations**: Miners often stay in the **Miner’s Rest**, a boarding house that caters to their needs.
- **Supply Hub**: The village’s blacksmith repairs tools, and local traders stock essentials like food, firewood, and simple equipment.
- **Processing and Storage**: Smaller quantities of ore are refined or stored in Brekenford before being transported along the Stillwater Trading Co. trade route.

#### **Economic Flow**

- **Incoming Miners**: Individual miners and small crews travel to Brekenford, drawn by its proximity to the Shattered Basin’s mining sites. They purchase supplies, rent accommodations, and often hire locals to transport goods.
- **Ore Transport**: Once ore is extracted, it is either:
    - Refined at a small-scale forge near the blacksmith’s shop.
    - Stored temporarily in Brekenford’s **Storage Barn** before being sent downriver when the Kendausk is navigable.
- **Trade Route Reliance**: Much of the ore and refined goods are transported to larger markets via the Stillwater Trading Co., tying Brekenford’s economy to the health of the river trade.

#### **Seasonal Impact**

- **Spring and Summer**: The mines operate at full capacity, and Brekenford sees an influx of miners and traders. Supplies flow steadily, and the village thrives on the increased activity.
- **Fall**: Mining slows as crews prepare for the harsh winter. Many miners leave until spring, reducing the village’s population temporarily.
- **Winter**: Mining is dangerous and difficult in winter conditions. Only a few hardy miners remain active, extracting minimal amounts of ore. Brekenford shifts to relying on stored goods and focuses on survival.
