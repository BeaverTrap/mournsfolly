Brekenford is a small but resilient village nestled in the Shattered Basin. Its economy is shaped by its proximity to natural resources and the needs of its isolated community. While the village relies partially on the Kendausk River trade route, it has established several self-sustaining industries that ensure its survival year-round. These industries provide the village with purpose, stability, and a unique character that reflects its harsh environment and close-knit population of 50–60 people.

#### **Primary Industries**

- **Mining Support**:  
    Brekenford serves as a waypoint for miners working in the Shattered Basin. Though the mines are not directly within the village, Brekenford provides a base for miners to rest, resupply, and transport materials. The blacksmith repairs tools, and the Miner’s Rest caters to those passing through. The ore brought in—primarily iron and tin—is refined in small quantities or transported further via the trade route. [[Mining Hub]]
    
- **Hunting and Trapping**:  
    The nearby forests provide wild game and furs essential for survival and trade. Villagers hunt deer, elk, and smaller animals like rabbits, while traps yield pelts for clothing and barter. Hunting also supplies meat and animal fats, which are preserved in the communal barn for the winter months.
    
- **Foraging and Herb Gathering**:  
    The harsh terrain around Brekenford is rich with hardy plants, frostberries, and wild herbs, especially in spring and summer. Villagers gather these resources for food, brewing, and medicine. Unique ingredients like Ironroot and Winter’s Frostcap Mushrooms are highly valued for their culinary and alchemical uses.
    

#### **Secondary Industries**

- **Small-Scale Agriculture**:  
    Though the rocky soil limits farming, the villagers grow root vegetables like turnips and carrots, along with winter grains like barley. These crops are stored communally in preparation for the long winter months.
    
- **Artisan Crafting**:  
    Brekenford’s artisans craft durable tools, hunting gear, and simple decorations from the resources available. The blacksmith is essential for maintaining mining equipment, while carpenters and leatherworkers create practical goods for trade and daily life.
    
- **Fishing and River Use**:  
    In warmer months, the Kendausk River provides a source of freshwater fish and trade access. During the winter, the river freezes over, limiting fishing but offering a possible route for ice harvesting and careful transport.
    

#### **Tertiary Roles**

- **Hospitality for Travelers**:  
    Located on the Stillwater Trading Co.’s trade route, Brekenford attracts miners, traders, and the occasional adventurer. The Miner’s Rest provides simple accommodations and meals, while the Brekenford Hearth serves as a communal space for villagers and visitors alike.
    
- **Seasonal Trade**:  
    While Brekenford’s population is small, it exports goods like furs, ores, and preserved foods to traders. Frostlight Lanterns—handcrafted by villagers—are a sought-after seasonal item during Frostlight Eve.
    

#### **Seasonal Flow of Activity**

- **Spring/Summer**: The village thrives with activity as miners and travelers pass through. Foraging and hunting are at their peak, and the forests and rivers yield valuable resources.
- **Fall**: Villagers focus on harvesting and preserving food, preparing for the winter months. The atmosphere is industrious but tense as the cold looms.
- **Winter**: The village becomes more insular, relying on stored goods, communal meals, and small-scale hunting or ice fishing. Trade slows to a trickle, and survival becomes the priority.
