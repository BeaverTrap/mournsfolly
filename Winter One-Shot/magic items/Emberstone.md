### **Description**
Emberstone is a rare, glowing mineral that radiates a subtle warmth and faint orange light. Found deep within ancient mountains and magically active regions, its properties make it highly sought after for crafting and enchantment. The stone is believed to contain residual energy from elemental fire, making it naturally resistant to extreme cold and a reliable source of heat in frozen environments.

### **Properties**
1. **Heat Source**:
   - Emberstone radiates a constant, gentle warmth that can stave off cold but is not enough to cause burns.  
   - A small shard can warm a 5-foot radius, making it useful for survival gear or long-term cold-weather exposure.

2. **Magic Conductivity**:
   - Its natural affinity for magic allows it to hold enchantments with ease.  
   - When integrated into items, it enhances their resistance to cold and can amplify fire-related properties.

3. **Durability**:
   - Emberstone is durable enough to be used in crafting tools, weapons, and armor, but it becomes brittle if overexposed to direct flames for prolonged periods.  
   - It retains its warmth indefinitely unless forcibly disrupted or magically drained.

4. **Flickering Glow**:
   - The stone emits a faint, pulsing orange light, bright enough to act as a dim light source in a 5-foot radius.  
   - Its glow dims if the stone is damaged or its magic depleted, though it can recover over time in magically rich areas.

### **Uses**
- **Crafting**:  
  Emberstone is a prized component in cold-weather survival gear, such as the **Cold Weather Cloak**, and in fire- or cold-themed magical items.  

- **Warding Magic**:  
  It can be used to fuel protective enchantments, such as those found along the **Old Road** to Grimhold.  
  
- **Alchemy**:  
  When ground into powder, emberstone serves as a reagent in alchemical recipes that create resistance to cold or amplify fire-based spells.

### **Harvesting**
- Found in veins deep within mountainous regions or areas of residual elemental fire magic.  
- Mining emberstone requires **Tools (DC 15)**, as the stone can shatter easily if struck improperly.  

- Unrefined emberstone is unstable and must be carefully processed before use.

### **Lore**
Legends tell of ancient sects using emberstone to maintain protective wards against frost-based fey and other cold-affiliated creatures. The stones were also used in ceremonial forges to craft weapons imbued with both warmth and magical resilience. Today, intact veins of emberstone are rare, and shards are considered invaluable relics by scholars and craftsmen alike.
