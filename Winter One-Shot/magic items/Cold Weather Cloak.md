### **Appearance**
This cloak is made of rugged crimson fabric, trimmed with soft, white fur along the edges and hood. Its design is both practical and striking, evoking the warmth and protection of a legendary figure of winter. The lining is interwoven with faintly glowing [[emberstone]] threads, which pulse gently in extreme cold, casting a comforting orange light. As its magic fades, the glow dims to a dull ember-like hue, though the cloak still offers excellent insulation against the biting chill.
