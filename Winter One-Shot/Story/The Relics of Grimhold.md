- The magical items within Grimhold adapt to the party size, ensuring that **each member of the party receives one item**.
    
- If there are **fewer than five players**, only the required number of relics are active, with the others remaining dormant. For instance:
    
    - **3 Players**: Only 3 relics glow and adapt, the rest staying inert.
    - **5 Players**: All 5 relics activate.
- This dynamic ensures the dungeon rewards are tailored to the party size while maintaining balance and ensuring every member gains a meaningful, class-specific reward.

### **How to Present These Relics**

1. **Appearance**:
    
    - The items should appear in their dormant state (e.g., a nondescript sword or unlit lantern) and adapt to the character who claims them.
2. **Adapting to the Player**:
    
    - When touched, the relic reshapes itself to suit the character’s preferred weapon or tool, glowing faintly as it attunes to their magic or combat style.

#### 6. **Frostbinder Crystal**

- **Description**: A crystalline shard encased in perpetually shimmering frost, glowing with faint fey runes. The crystal hums softly when touched, exuding an aura of warmth that contrasts with its icy appearance.
    
- **Effect**: The Frostbinder Crystal can be used at Caryth’s lair to bypass both the Ice Golem guardian and the frost barrier.
    
    - **Barrier Disruption**: When pressed against the frost barrier, the crystal absorbs its magical energy, causing the barrier to dissipate in a cascade of light.
    - **Ice Golem Neutralization**: The crystal emits a soothing pulse of energy that deactivates the Ice Golem, rendering it inert. The golem freezes solid and becomes a stationary, harmless statue.
- **Alternate Use**: If the crystal is broken, it releases its stored energy in a protective burst. All allied creatures within 30 feet gain resistance to cold damage for 1 hour and advantage on saving throws against magical effects caused by fey creatures. **Breaking the crystal destroys it permanently.**
    
- **Narrative Connection**: The Frostbinder Crystal was crafted by the fey hunters to counteract Caryth’s frost-based magic. It represents their hope of sealing her away permanently but was abandoned in Grimhold after their failure.
