## **Scene 1: Entering the Lair**

### **Setup**

The lair’s entrance looms ominously, with frost and shadow intertwining across its surface. The environment reflects Caryth’s magic, disorienting and oppressing those who enter. 

---

### **Narration (Read or Paraphrase)**

> The oppressive cold of the Blackpine Thicket intensifies as you approach Caryth’s lair. Massive, jagged shards of ice protrude from the frozen ground, forming an unnatural barrier that seems to breathe with life. The entrance is marked by a great rift in the ice, dark and foreboding, as though the forest itself recoils from Caryth’s power. A faint light pulses within, and the cries of the children grow louder, urging you onward.

---

### **Challenges**

1. **Frozen Barrier**:
    
    - **Without the Core**:
        - The barrier requires **Arcana (DC 16)** to dispel or **Strength (DC 18)** to break through.
    - **With the Core**:
        - The core melts the barrier instantly, creating a safe path forward.

2. **Illusory Paths**:
    
    - Caryth’s magic twists the environment, creating false paths.
    - **Insight (DC 14)**: Identify the illusions and avoid disorientation.
    - Failure: The party becomes lost, losing time and suffering **1 level of exhaustion**.

3. **Environmental Hazards**:
    
    - **Ice Shards**: Jagged ice falls from the ceiling, requiring a **Dexterity Saving Throw (DC 14)** to avoid **2d6 piercing damage**.
    - **Freezing Winds**: The oppressive cold forces a **Constitution Saving Throw (DC 13)** to avoid **1d6 cold damage**.

---

### **DM Notes**

- Highlight the advantages of the **Emberstone Core** when used, such as bypassing hazards or providing warmth to mitigate exhaustion.
- If the party does not have the core, emphasize their ingenuity and creative problem-solving.

## **Scene 2: Navigating the Sanctum**

### **Description for the DM**

The sanctum is an expansive maze of icy corridors and corrupted magic. The walls pulse faintly, as though alive, and the air grows colder the deeper the party ventures.

---

### **Narration (Read or Paraphrase)**

> The icy walls of the lair shimmer with malevolent light, distorting your reflection as though the ice itself mocks you. The cold grows more oppressive with each step, clawing at your resolve. Whispers echo faintly, an eerie cacophony of voices that seem to urge you to turn back. But the cries of the children pierce through the darkness, guiding your path forward.

---

### **Challenges**

1. **Animated Constructs**:
    
    - **Without the Core**:
        - Frostbound constructs attack the party at intervals, using **Animated Armor** stats modified for cold damage.
    - **With the Core**:
        - The core’s heat disrupts the constructs, reducing their HP by half.

2. **Illusory Traps**:
    
    - Caryth’s magic creates illusory floors and doors that lead to hidden pits or traps.
    - **Investigation (DC 15)**: Discern real paths from illusions.
    - Failure: The party triggers a trap, taking **2d8 cold damage**.

3. **Frost Wards**:
    
    - **Without the Core**:
        - Arcane wards block progress, requiring **Dispel Magic** or an **Arcana (DC 17)** check to bypass.
    - **With the Core**:
        - The core disrupts the wards, allowing safe passage.

---

## **Scene 3: The Final Confrontation**

### **Description for the DM**

Caryth’s sanctum is a towering hall of ice and shadow, dominated by a crystalline pillar that radiates her power. The children lie encased in frost around the room, their lives tethered to Caryth’s magic.

---

### **Boss Encounter: Caryth Nythis**

1. **Without the Core**:
    
    - The party must rely on their wits and abilities to defeat Caryth, navigating her lair actions and illusions.

2. **With the Core**:
    
    - The Emberstone Core offers a powerful, but costly, option:
        - Players can activate the core to deal massive damage to Caryth (**8d10 fire damage**).
        - Using the core causes it to shatter, creating shrapnel that forces a **Dexterity Saving Throw (DC 17)** for all creatures to avoid **4d6 fire and piercing damage**.

---

    Caryth uses frost magic and illusions to confuse and weaken the party.

    - **Illusory Duplicates**: Forces **Investigation (DC 15)** to target the real Caryth.

2. **Phase 2 (50% HP)**:  
    Caryth merges with the lair, summoning shards of ice and environmental hazards.
    
    - **Lair Action—Shattering Ice**: Forces **Dexterity Saving Throws (DC 16)** to avoid **3d6 piercing damage**.
    - **Summon Frost Warden**: Calls forth a corrupted guardian to assist her.

3. **Phase 3 (25% HP)**:  
    Caryth merges with the crystal, becoming an avatar of ice and shadow.
    
    - **Frost Avatar Slam**: Melee attack dealing **6d10 cold and bludgeoning damage**.
    - **Frost Nova (Recharge 5–6)**: Area attack dealing **5d10 cold damage**.

---

### **Victory Conditions**

    - The party must defeat Caryth through conventional combat.

2. **With the Core**:
    
    - The party can use the Emberstone Core to deal overwhelming damage, but the shrapnel creates additional risks.

---

### **Outcome**
