###  Skirting the Edge of the Thicket**

#### **Overview**

The journey to [[Grimhold]] avoids the dense and treacherous interior of the Blackpine Thicket, instead following the remnants of an ancient, overgrown path that winds along the base of Shadowcraig. This route provides easier terrain to navigate compared to the unpredictable forest interior, allowing the party to make better time despite the rugged conditions and occasional obstacles.

### **Path Details**

1. **Old Road Along the Edge of the Thicket**

- **Path Description**:  
    The Old Road is ancient, its purpose long forgotten. Worn stone markers and faint wheel ruts are all that remain of a once-clear path, now overgrown and frost-covered. The terrain hugs the base of **Shadowcraig**, avoiding the deeper dangers of the **Blackpine Thicket**. Though the weather is harsh, the predictable terrain makes travel faster and easier than venturing into the forest.

- **Weather and Environment**:  
    Heavy snow and icy winds cut across the trail, but the party avoids the creeping influence of **Caryth Nythis** within the thicket. Still, the forest looms close, its oppressive quiet broken only by distant cracking branches and the eerie stillness of trees frozen unnaturally in place.

- **Player Checks**:
    
    - **Survival Check (DC 10)**: To follow the faded path and avoid losing time.
    - **Perception Check (DC 12)**: Glimpses of strange frost patterns on nearby trees suggest unnatural forces deeper in the forest.

### **Key Details**

- The party notices **[[#1. **The Warden's Marker**|old markers]]** with faded carvings along the road. 

- If **Errol is present**, he notes the carvings as "unusual" but doesn’t connect them to anything specific, dismissing them as remnants of a long-lost group. he might draw them in a small notebook for later study.

### **Key Encounters and Events**

#### **The Warden's Marker**

- Along the **Old Road**, the party notices occasional **stone obelisks** spaced at irregular intervals. Each marker stands weathered and partially overgrown, their carvings faintly visible beneath frost and moss.

- The carvings show shadowy figures in chains surrounded by flames, though the exact meaning is unclear. Despite their age, the markers radiate a faint warmth, offering brief reprieves from the biting cold of the surrounding landscape.

---

**Player Interaction with a Marker**

- If the party chooses to **investigate the carvings further**, they can make checks to learn more:
    
    - **Investigation (DC 12)**: Reveals the carvings in greater detail. The symbols seem to depict containment or sealing, as if meant to repel or ward off something external.
    - **Arcana (DC 13)**: Recognizes faint traces of warding magic tied to the markers, specifically designed to counteract fey corruption and magical influence.

- **Tampering with a Marker**:  
    If the party inspects a marker more closely, they discover a hidden compartment at its base. Inside is a shard of **emberstone**, glowing faintly orange and radiating warmth.

**Consequences of Removing an Emberstone**

- **Local Effect**:  
    As soon as the emberstone is removed, the marker loses its warmth, and the protective ward tied to it weakens.
    
    - The immediate area around the road grows colder, and the once-subtle influence of the **Blackpine Thicket** begins to seep toward the path.
    - Frost patterns spread unnaturally along rocks and trees, and the groaning sounds of the forest become more pronounced.

- **Path-Wide Effect** (Optional):  
    Removing a single shard doesn’t fully compromise the protective warding system, but it creates a **localized breach** where the forest’s magic begins to stretch outward.
    
    - **Narrative Hook**: If multiple emberstones are removed during the journey, the ward along the entire path could collapse, allowing the party to see and experience the full extent of Caryth Nythis’s influence creeping toward the road.

- **Encounters from Tampering**
	
	- The first emberstone removal causes no immediate threat but creates a sense of growing unease.
	
	- **Additional Removals**: Subsequent tampering escalates the danger, potentially allowing corrupted creatures or fey-aligned entities (e.g., wisps or small beasts) to cross the boundary and harass the party.

**Errol’s Reaction (If Present)**

- If the party investigates a marker in depth, Errol may speculate that the markers are part of some long-forgotten magical defense.

- If the emberstone is removed, he becomes visibly uneasy, remarking that the markers may be holding back something significant. He advises caution but is reluctant to interfere further, especially as the path begins to feel less safe.

---

#### **Blackpine Predators**

- At the edge of the thicket, the party is stalked by **two [[Frost Lynx|Frost Lynxes]]** (cold-adapted predators with stealth and pounce abilities). The [[Frost Lynx|lynxes]] attack opportunistically from ambush, retreating if heavily injured.
    - **Combat Notes**: Use the [[Frost Lynx]] stat block.
    - **Dungeon Delicacies**: Harvestable table for [[Frost Lynx]]

---

#### **Waystation Ruin**

- Near the end of the path, the party encounters the collapsed remains of an ancient waystation. A faint glow of emberstone veins emanates from the rubble, casting an otherworldly light.
    - **Search Options**:
        - **Perception (DC 13)**: Uncovers a **Cold Weather Cloak**, granting resistance to cold damage for 1 hour per day.
        - **Arcana (DC 15)**: Reveals that the emberstone veins once powered magical wards, possibly connected to Grimhold’s defenses.
    - **Narrative Hook**: The ruin feels eerily still, and characters may sense they’re walking through a place marked by ancient conflict. If Errol is present, he might note the age of the construction but attribute it to long-forgotten fey hunter groups, unaware of its deeper ties to his Order.

### **Arrival at Grimhold**

- **The Final Stretch**:  
    The road grows steeper, and jagged stone steps carved into [[Shadowcraig]]’s base guide the party upward. The faint glow of [[emberstone]] veins in the surrounding rock flickers through frost-covered cracks.

Grimhold’s entrance is a masterpiece of treated Emberstone construction, its polished black stone radiating a controlled warmth that melts snow in a wide radius. Unlike the raw veins of untreated Emberstone found within the jagged rocks of Shadowcraig—faintly glowing and smoldering beneath the snow—this dungeon was meticulously crafted to harness the full potential of its materials. The result is a structure that stands in stark contrast to its environment: smooth, pristine, and untouched by the frost that blankets the surrounding wilderness.

Narration (Read or Paraphrase):**

> The jagged peaks of Shadowcraig surround you, their dark, snow-covered spires clawing at the overcast sky. Amid the frozen desolation, Grimhold emerges, an unnatural oasis of heat and precision. Its polished black stone gleams, free from snow or ice, as though impervious to the winter’s grip. Faintly glowing veins of Emberstone run through its surface, their treated radiance exuding a steady warmth that melts the frost and leaves the ground dry around the structure.

> Nearby, the jagged rocks of Shadowcraig betray glimpses of raw, untreated Emberstone, faintly smoldering beneath patches of snow, but Grimhold’s construction is a work of deliberate artistry. The heat is comforting yet unnatural, the air thick with an oppressive energy that presses against your skin. The dungeon stands in stark contrast to the wilderness, its smooth, flawless architecture both inviting and foreboding.

> At its center, an arched entrance gapes open, framed by glowing veins of Emberstone that pulse faintly in the dim light. It feels alive, almost sentient, as though watching your every move, daring you to step closer.
