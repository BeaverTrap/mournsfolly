**Overview**

Act 3 bridges the Blackpine Thicket and Caryth’s lair, featuring escalating challenges through the corrupted forest and culminating in a confrontation with the **Ice Golem** at the threshold of her domain. Depending on the party’s starting location, their journey through the thicket will vary in distance and intensity.

---

## Scene 1: Entering the Thicket

- **From the Frost Wolves Encounter**:
    
    - **Starting Point:** The party begins at the forest edge, 25 miles from Caryth’s lair.
    - **Setup:** The children’s tracks lead into the dense, dark forest. Snow and ice obscure the path, and whispers echo faintly through the air.
    - **Initial Challenge:**
        - _Survival Check (DC 13):_ To follow the tracks.
        - Failure: The party risks becoming lost and faces additional hazards.

**Narration (Read or Paraphrase):**

> The Blackpine Thicket stretches before you, its towering trees coated in frost. Tracks in the snow seem to vanish as the forest grows darker, the whispering wind tugging at your thoughts. Shadows ripple unnaturally as if alive, and the distant cry of a child echoes faintly.

- **From Brakenford After Regrouping**:
    
    - **Starting Point:** The party begins at the same forest edge but with no visible tracks.
    - **Setup:** The party relies on Errol Niles’s knowledge or signs of corruption to navigate.
    - **Initial Challenge:**
        - _Arcana Check (DC 14):_ To sense the residual magic.
        - Failure: Minor traps delay progress or impose exhaustion checks.

**Narration (Read or Paraphrase):**

> The forest looms before you, more hostile than before. Fresh snow has erased any sign of the children’s passage, leaving you to rely on faint traces of magic or intuition. Frost-covered branches hang low, creating an oppressive tunnel that pulls you deeper into the unknown.

- **From Grimhold**:
    
    - **Starting Point:** The party starts at the 20-mile mark, only 5 miles from Caryth’s lair.
    - **Setup:** The forest here is deeply corrupted, with reality bending to Caryth’s will.
	- **Initial Challenge:**
		- _Perception Check (DC 15):_ To navigate through the thick magical fog.
		- Failure: The party triggers **Corrupted Roots** (1d6 bludgeoning damage, grapples on failed Strength Save, DC 14).

**Narration (Read or Paraphrase):**

> The heart of the forest is twisted beyond recognition. The air itself feels heavy, and the ground shimmers with frost that shifts beneath your feet. Shadows stretch unnaturally, and whispers now rise to a deafening hum, mocking your every step.

## **Scene 2: Progression Through the Thicket**

**Guiding Mechanics**

- **Navigation Rolls:**  
    Each zone requires _Survival, Arcana, or Insight_ checks (DC varies) to traverse safely.

- **Encounter Frequency:**  
    Roll a **d6** every 5 miles:
    - 1–2: Minor environmental hazard.
    - 3–4: Random encounter.
    - 5–6: Major environmental hazard or combat encounter.

- **Corruption Points:**  
    For each failed roll, add a **Corruption Point**:
    - 1–2 Points: Minor hallucinations or whispers.
    - 3–4 Points: Exhaustion checks every mile.
    - 5+ Points: Final battle with the Ice Golem gains enhancements (+1 AC, +2 damage).

### **Zone Progression**

#### **Mile 5–10: The Outer Thicket**

- **Challenge:** Twisting paths and icy terrain.
    
    - _Survival Check (DC 12):_ Avoid frost-covered ground.
    - _Failure:_ _Dexterity Save (DC 14)_ to avoid frost spikes, taking **2d6 piercing damage**.
- **Encounter:** Illusions of the children lead into traps.
    
    - _Insight Check (DC 14):_ Recognize the illusions.
    - _Failure:_ An **Ice Trap** erupts, dealing **2d8 cold damage** in a 10-foot radius.

**Narration (Read or Paraphrase):**

> The path twists and turns as frost-covered roots rise from the ground like grasping hands. Through the mist, you glimpse small figures darting between the trees, their faint cries urging you to follow. The forest seems to shift underfoot, leading you dangerously close to icy traps.

---

#### **Mile 10–15: The Mid Thicket**

- **Challenge:** Haunting whispers disorient the party.
    
    - _Wisdom Save (DC 14):_ Resist psychic effects.
    - _Failure:_ Take **1d6 psychic damage** and disadvantage on the next check.
- **Encounter:** Frost Sprites launch hit-and-run attacks.
    
    - _Combat:_ 3–5 Frost Sprites use _Frostbolt_ and _Blur_.
    - _Reward:_ Harvestable **Fey Shards** (valuable crafting materials).

**Narration (Read or Paraphrase):**

> The air hums with whispers, each word tugging at your resolve. Shadows flicker, and flashes of icy magic dart from the trees as small, fey-like creatures attack and vanish. Their laughter echoes eerily, blending with the ever-present whispers.

---

#### **Mile 15–20: The Inner Thicket**

- **Challenge:** The oppressive cold deepens, and the landscape shifts subtly, as though the forest itself resists your passage. Frost-covered trees loom higher, their gnarled branches creating a dense canopy that blocks out even the faintest light.
    
    - **Constitution Save (DC 14):** Resist the intensifying cold to avoid **1 level of exhaustion**.
    - **Survival Check (DC 13):** Navigate through the maze-like terrain. Failure delays progress, adding another hour to the journey.

**Narration (Read or Paraphrase):**

> The deeper you venture, the less natural the forest feels. The trees stand impossibly still, their frozen bark shimmering faintly with an otherworldly light. The air grows heavier, each breath forming thick clouds of mist that linger unnaturally in the stillness. Your footsteps crunch loudly against the brittle snow, but the sound feels swallowed by the towering silence around you. Shadows stretch unnaturally across the ground, twisting with each flicker of your torchlight.

> At times, the path seems to lead you in circles. Branches groan and crack under the weight of ice, creating faint, eerie echoes that seem to come from all directions. The biting cold seeps through your layers of clothing, making your limbs feel heavy as frost clings stubbornly to your skin.
---

#### **Mile 20–25: The Heart of the Thicket**

- **Challenge:** Shattering ice spikes and oppressive frost.
    
    - _Dexterity Save (DC 15):_ Avoid spikes erupting from the ground, dealing **2d8 cold damage**.
- **Encounter:** **Frost Lynxes** ambush the party.
    
    - _Combat:_ 2–4 lynxes use stealth, pounce, and frostbite attacks.
    - _Reward:_ Harvestable pelts and meat, providing **Dungeon Delicacies** buffs.

**Narration (Read or Paraphrase):**

> The forest closes in, its oppressive aura sapping warmth and hope. Frosted lynxes emerge from the shadows, their glowing eyes fixed on you. They circle with eerie silence, their breath visible as icy vapor.

## **Scene 3: Confronting the Ice Golem**

### **Setup**

At the forest’s edge, the party encounters the **Ice Golem**, standing as the final obstacle before Caryth’s lair. This hulking construct of frost and jagged ice moves to intercept intruders, its frosty aura emanating a palpable sense of menace.

**Narration (Read or Paraphrase):**

> The forest opens into a clearing dominated by a towering construct of jagged ice. Its hollow eyes glow with an eerie blue light as it moves to intercept. Frost crackles with every step, the frozen gates behind it shimmering faintly with Caryth’s magic.

### **Core Utility**:

If the party possesses the **Emberstone Core**, they gain:

- Resistance to cold damage within a **10-foot aura**.
- **Arcana (DC 13)**: Use the core to suppress frost-based hazards, bypassing terrain difficulties.

---

**Narration (Read or Paraphrase):**

> The Blackpine Thicket narrows, its gnarled trees twisting unnaturally as though reaching for you. Frost clings to every surface, glinting in the dim light like shards of glass. The air hums faintly with magic, and whispers echo from the shadows, growing louder with each step. Ahead, the path seems to shift and ripple, illusions of the missing children darting between the trees, their cries both urgent and unnerving.

---

### **The Encounter**

1. **Combat Mechanics**:
    
    - **Without the Core**:
        
        - The Ice Golem is at full strength:
            - **AC 16, HP 120**.
            - **Cold Slam:** Melee attack dealing **2d10+4 cold damage**.
            - **Frozen Aura:** All creatures within 10 feet take **1d6 cold damage** at the start of their turn.
        - No environmental advantages—players must rely on teamwork and brute strength.
		 
	- **With the Core**:
        - The **Emberstone Core** offers critical options:
            - **Arcana (DC 13):** Weaken the Ice Golem’s magic, reducing its HP by 30.
            - **Direct Strike (Energy Discharge, 1/Day):** Target the golem with the core, dealing **6d6 fire damage**, bypassing its frost aura, and reducing its speed by half.

2. **Environmental Hazards**:
    
    - **Frosted Ground:** The icy battlefield requires **Dexterity Saves (DC 13)** to avoid slipping and falling prone.
    - **Shattering Spikes:** Icy shards erupt from the ground during the fight, forcing **Dexterity Saves (DC 14)** or taking **2d6 piercing damage**.

---

**Narration (Read or Paraphrase):**

> The trees part abruptly, revealing a massive construct of jagged ice standing before a set of frozen gates. The Ice Golem’s hollow eyes glow faintly, its frosted limbs groaning as it moves into position. Each step sends ripples of cold through the air, the frost beneath it cracking and reforming with every motion. The gates shimmer faintly behind it, pulsing with Caryth’s magic. The construct’s movements are deliberate and unyielding, a silent sentinel determined to block your path.

---

## **Scene 3: The Frozen Gates**

### **Setup**

After defeating the Ice Golem, the frozen gates to Caryth’s lair creak open. The air beyond is heavy with malevolent energy, signaling the start of the final confrontation.

**Narration (Read or Paraphrase):**

> As the Ice Golem crumbles into shards, the gates behind it groan and crack, ice splintering away to reveal a dark corridor beyond. A wave of oppressive energy seeps through the opening, accompanied by the faint, mocking laughter of Caryth Nythis. The cries of the children grow louder, and the air itself seems to pull you forward into the shadowed depths of her lair.

---

### **Outcome**

1. **Victory**:
    - The frozen gates open, granting the party access to Caryth’s lair.

2. **Failure**:
    - If the party retreats, they may regroup and return with additional resources or new strategies.
