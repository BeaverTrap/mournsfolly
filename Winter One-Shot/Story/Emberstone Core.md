# Emberstone Core Mechanics

### **In Grimhold: Room 4 - The Forge Guardian**

#### **Core Mechanics During the Encounter**

1. **Identification:**
    
    - **Investigation (DC 17):** Spot the Emberstone Core embedded in the base of the forge.
    - **Arcana (DC 15):** Understand its purpose as the power source for the **Molten Grimstone Guardian** and deduce how to weaken or extract it.

2. **Weakening and Extracting the Core:**
    
    - **Melee Attack (AC 15, HP 15):** Striking the core weakens its structure without destroying it. Once reduced to 0 HP:
        - The **Molten Grimstone Guardian** freezes, and its molten veins fade to black.
        - The forge dims, and the room’s heat subsides.
        - The core remains intact and ready for extraction.

3. **Hazard from the Core:**
    
    - On a failed Arcana check or a critical failure when attacking the core, its energy surges:
        - All creatures within 10 feet must succeed on a **Dexterity Saving Throw (DC 14)** or take **2d6 fire damage**.
        - The surge also causes the **Lashing Emberstone Veins** to activate, dealing an additional **1d6 fire damage** to creatures within 5 feet of the forge.

4. **Post-Encounter Functionality:**
    
    - Once extracted, the core is stored as a magical item with the following properties:
        - **Heat Reservoir:** Grants resistance to cold damage to all creatures within 10 feet of the core while it is carried.
        - **Energy Discharge (1/Day):** The core can unleash a pulse of radiant heat in a **15-foot radius**, forcing all creatures in the area to make a **Constitution Saving Throw (DC 15)** or take **4d6 fire damage** and suffer **1 level of exhaustion** on a failure. Creatures immune to fire damage are unaffected.

### **In Caryth’s Lair: Multiple Uses**

1. **Bypassing Caryth’s Ice Golem:**
    
    - The Emberstone Core can be used to bypass or weaken Caryth’s **Ice Golem Guardian**, which defends her lair’s entrance.
    - **Arcana (DC 13):** Activate the core’s energy to weaken the Ice Golem’s icy defenses, forcing it to freeze in place and become dormant.
    - **Physical Placement:** Positioning the core within 10 feet of the Ice Golem melts its frozen form, rendering it inactive for the remainder of the encounter.

1. **Enhancing the Party Against Caryth:**
    
    - **Resistance to Cold:** The core continues to grant cold resistance to all creatures within 10 feet, providing vital protection against Caryth’s frost-based attacks.
    - **Energy Discharge (1/Day):** The core’s energy can be unleashed in combat against Caryth, dealing significant damage to her and any other frost-aligned enemies:
        - **Effect on Caryth:** The pulse deals **6d6 fire damage**, ignores her resistance to fire damage, and suppresses her frost-based abilities (e.g., ice shields, freezing auras) for 1 round.
        - **Effect on Allies:** Any party members in the pulse’s radius take **2d6 fire damage** (Constitution Saving Throw (DC 15) to halve) unless they are immune or resistant to fire.

1. **Narrative Options - Weaponizing the Core:**
    
    - Players can integrate the Emberstone Core into their strategy by modifying it for unique effects:
        - **Arcana or Tinkering (DC 18):** Embed the core into a weapon or magical device, creating a one-time fire-based attack that deals **8d6 fire damage** in a **30-foot cone**.

### **DM Notes:**

1. **Balancing Risk and Reward:**
    
    - Using the Emberstone Core should feel powerful but come with risks, such as damaging allies or drawing additional attention from Caryth or her minions.
    - Encourage creative use of the core by allowing players to experiment with its energy.

2. **Integrating Mechanics Into the Story:**
    
    - Highlight the core’s fiery energy as a counter to Caryth’s frost magic, creating a thematic payoff for the players’ efforts in Grimhold.
    - Emphasize its potential in both bypassing obstacles and empowering the party, rewarding clever play.

3. **Consequences of Core Misuse:**
    
    - If the players mishandle the core (e.g., using it recklessly or without understanding its power), it could explode:
        - **Explosion Effect:** A massive burst of fire engulfs a **30-foot radius**, dealing **8d6 fire damage** to all creatures in the area (Dexterity Saving Throw (DC 16) to halve).
