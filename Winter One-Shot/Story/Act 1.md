#### **Introduction**

The [[Silvermaw Peaks]] encircle the [[Shattered Basin]], their jagged summits forming a natural fortress around the windswept expanse. **To the west**, the [[Blackstone Crags]] rise in stark, imposing formations. Their highest point, **[[Blackspire Summit]]**, is the second tallest peak in the region and home to the infamous dungeon known as **[[Blackmaw]]**, a place whispered of across the lands for its dangers and treasures. Surrounding the Crags is the [[Blackpine Thicket]], a vast forest of ancient trees as tall as redwoods or sequoias. Their bark, dark as charcoal from the minerals of the Crags, creates a striking contrast with their lush green pine needles. **To the east**, the [[Snowmantle Spires]] shimmer under perpetual frost, crowned by the towering [[Mount Silverglent]], the tallest peak in the Silvermaw range. Together, these landmarks cradle the Basin, a land of striking beauty and unforgiving winters.

At the heart of this rugged terrain lies the village of [[Brakenford]], a small but enduring community. Its people, numbering **55**, are composed of families and essential tradespeople who weather the cycles of the seasons with resilience. Just six weeks ago, the birth of a baby girl, **Audra**, brought new life and hope to the village—a rare moment of celebration in the shadow of the encroaching cold.

This winter, however, has tested [[Brakenford]] as never before. The [[Kendausk River]], which winds through the Basin and connects the village to distant trade routes, is frozen solid, cutting off essential supplies from the Stillwater Trading Co. Though the villagers prepared as best they could, the isolation weighs heavily on their spirits. The warmth of their close-knit community and the [[Brakenford Hearth]] has become their greatest resource against the biting frost.

Tonight, the Hearth glows brightly as the village gathers for Frostlight Eve, a cherished tradition that celebrates resilience and shared hope. Wreaths of Blackpine branches hang from the walls, and small decorated Blackpine trees stand proudly near the tables, their roots cradling wrapped presents for the children. At the center of the hall, a ceremonial fixture casts a warm, flickering light, its candles symbolizing unity in the face of winter’s darkness. The blizzard outside howls with a ferocity that defies memory, yet within the Hearth’s glow, the people of Brakenford share food, stories, and fleeting laughter. Children dart between tables, their joy weaving into the hum of conversation. But outside, the storm’s unrelenting fury hints at something more—a chilling force beyond mortal understanding. Something ancient and cold stirs in the shadows, its gaze fixed on the children whose joy lights the night.

To immerse the players, read or paraphrase the following:

> Outside, the wind howls like a mournful wail, carrying flurries of snow that pile high against the Hearth’s wooden walls. Smoke rises sluggishly from chimneys, vanishing into an ashen sky that refuses to relent even for a night of celebration. The blizzard intensifies, but within the Hearth’s warm embrace, the light and laughter of Frostlight Eve push back the encroaching cold.
> 
> The grand hall is alive with activity, its walls adorned with wreaths of Blackpine branches, their dark bark and vibrant needles contrasting with the soft glow of Frostlight Lanterns. Small Blackpine trees, carefully decorated, stand near the tables, their roots cradling neatly wrapped presents for the children. At the center of the room, a ceremonial fixture burns brightly, its candles casting a flickering warmth that rivals the fire at the heart of the Hearth.
> 
> Villagers crowd the long wooden tables, their laughter and chatter mingling with the scents of smoked venison, spiced porridge, and **Frostlight Solace Stew**—a dish famed for its invigorating properties. At the head of the room, Mrs. Fenwick ladles steaming bowls of stew with practiced grace, her smile unwavering despite the strain of the winter. Nearby, her husband sharpens his knife with slow, deliberate motions, his eyes scanning the room with quiet pride.
> 
> Children dart between tables, their laughter ringing out like bells. Ralph Fenwick leads the charge, his trusty rifle slung across his back. A jagged scar above his left eye catches the flickering light, and his faintly glowing, slightly discolored eye—a magical replacement carved from a pearl of the mountain—marks him as both fortunate and scarred by past events. “I’ll hunt the blizzard itself!” he boasts, puffing out his chest and drawing laughter and playful scolding from the adults. His younger brother Randy trails close behind, mimicking Ralph’s every move with wide-eyed determination. Wendy McAllister giggles shyly from the corner, while Kevin Haywood rolls his eyes, muttering about Ralph’s stories. Paulie Pfeffman tries to keep the peace, laughing loudly and cheering on both sides.

As the children weave through the tables, Ralphie boasts to a gathering of his peers about his exploits, his glowing eye catching the flicker of the Hearth’s flames. This is the moment the party introduces themselves to the rest of the gathering, sharing their connections to the village or how they’ve come to be part of the Frostlight Eve celebration.

Mrs. Fenwick, noticing Ralphie’s boisterous confidence, waves him and Randy over. “Boys, enough showing off for now. Help me hand out bowls of stew, will you? Everyone’s waiting on it,” she says with a warm but firm tone. "Yes mother!" the boys shout back at the same time. Ralphie and Randy dutifully begin delivering the steaming bowls of her famous **hearty stew**, a dish the townsfolk request year after year, its aroma filling the hall with the promise of warmth and comfort.

Nearby, Mr. Fenwick sharpens his knife with a faint smile. His attention shifts to the Hearth, where the centerpiece of tonight’s meal—a trio of **roasted wylderling**—cooks to perfection. He chuckles to himself and mutters, “If only I could keep all three to myself,” a playful glint in his eye betraying his anticipation. The townsfolk are abuzz with excitement for the rare delicacy, its preparation a reminder of the Fenwicks’ resourcefulness and culinary skill.

### **Triggering the Blizzard**

When the players have finished exploring and interacting with the market or express readiness to advance the story, the storm begins to build.

#### **Scene Description**

As the final bell for Frostlight Eve rings, the warm festivities are interrupted. Read or paraphrase:

> A sudden gust of wind howls through the Hearth, rattling its wooden walls. Frost begins to creep across the windows, and the jovial chatter fades to worried murmurs. Outside, the blizzard thickens, its fury rising with unnatural speed.

This transition sets the stage for the **Blizzard Strikes** sequence.

---

#### **The Blizzard Strikes**

The warm glow of Frostlight Eve is extinguished in a moment of terror. The players are thrust into a chilling, high-stakes scenario. 

> A deafening gust of wind slams against the Hearth, rattling its sturdy walls and extinguishing the fire in an icy burst. The radiant warmth of the stone is snuffed out, leaving the room plunged into chilling darkness. The laughter fades to stunned silence as frost creeps across the floorboards like reaching fingers, and the air grows deathly cold.
>
>“Where is Ralphie? Where’s Randy?” Mrs. Fenwick’s voice cuts through the tension, her bowl of stew slipping from her hands and shattering on the stone floor. Her eyes dart wildly around the room. Villagers exchange panicked glances, their breaths visible in the freezing air.
>
>“Wendy!” Eliza McAllister cries, clutching the edge of a table as her voice trembles with fear. “Where’s Audra?” Her gaze shifts frantically to the crib near the Hearth, now eerily empty.
>
>“Paul? Kevin?” Clara Pfeffman calls, her voice rising as she pushes past villagers, scanning every corner. “Edward, they were right here!”
>
>“Where’s Kevin? Where's my boy?” Jack Haywood’s gruff voice breaks as he grabs his wife’s hand, their eyes darting to where Wayne, their eldest, sits stunned. Kevin, along with all the younger children, is gone.
>
>Suddenly, the heavy wooden door creaks open as though forced by an unseen hand. A biting wind rushes inside, carrying snow that swirls in unnatural patterns. The air is filled with the rising murmur of despair, the villagers’ voices blending into a chaotic chorus of names:  
>“Paulie!”  
>“Winnie!”  
>“The baby, where’s the baby?”
>
>The sound of a low, melodic chime echoes faintly through the hall, chilling the villagers to their cores.

Stepping outside into the square, they are met with a haunting sight: the entire village is encased in frost, every tree, building, and lantern frozen as though captured mid-motion. Most terrifying of all, the children—every single one—are gone. Tiny tracks trail away from the Hearth, leading toward the forest’s edge before disappearing into the storm.

#### **Caryth Nythis’s Arrival**

The players’ first encounter with Caryth Nythis solidifies her as a chilling, otherworldly antagonist.

> From the swirling snow steps a woman of haunting beauty and malice. Her alabaster skin glows faintly, untouched by the biting wind, and her long silver hair flows unnaturally, as if moved by an unseen current. She moves with a dancer’s grace, her every step leaving crystalline frost in her wake. Around her, jagged shards of ice rise from the snow, shifting and cracking like living things. Her piercing, ice-blue eyes sweep across the frozen village, lingering briefly on each terrified face.
> 
> Without speaking, she raises a hand, and the howling wind intensifies, carrying with it faint whispers of despair. The snow begins to coalesce, forming into snarling wolves with glowing, icy eyes. They prowl toward the villagers, their jagged forms crunching with each movement. The woman’s expression shifts into a cruel smile before she spins gracefully and vanishes into the storm, leaving her frozen minions to confront anyone brave—or foolish—enough to follow.

The players can engage in combat with the **[[Frost Wolf]]**, giving them a taste of the challenges ahead.
