### **Scene 1: Into the Shattered Basin**

#### **Setup 1: If the Party Follows the Tracks**

- **Overview:** Choosing to pursue the children’s footprints, the party heads deeper into the forest. Snow and shadows create a challenging and foreboding environment as they attempt to keep the trail in sight.
- **Challenges:**
    - **Tracking Mechanics:** The players make **Survival (Wisdom) checks (DC 13)** to follow the fading tracks. Failure causes delays and risks losing the trail entirely, requiring additional checks to find it again.
    - **Clues Along the Path:** Faint hints, like scraps of fabric or a dropped mitten, confirm the children’s route. Successful **Investigation (Intelligence) checks (DC 12)** uncover these details.

**Narration (Read or Paraphrase):**

>  The footprints weave through the snow-laden forest, growing faint in open areas but reappearing in the drifts beneath the thick canopy. The storm’s wind carries distant whispers that tug at your senses, as though the forest itself is alive. Scattered clues—a mitten half-buried in snow, a piece of fabric snagged on a branch—speak of the children’s desperation, urging you forward into the storm.

**Errol’s Entrance:**  
As the party progresses, [[Errol Niles]] catches up to them, bringing supplies and sharing vital information about [[Caryth Nythis]]. His nervous demeanor belies his determination to help.

#### **Setup 2: If the Party Returns to Brakenford**

- **Overview:** Opting to regroup and seek guidance, the party returns to [[Brakenford Hearth]]. The Hearth is filled with worried villagers, including [[Karen Haywood]], who is overcome with grief for her brother Kevin. [[Errol Niles]] approaches the party with supplies and crucial insights into [[Caryth Nythis]].

**Narration (Read or Paraphrase):**

> Inside the [[Brakenford Hearth]], a heavy silence fills the room, broken only by the murmurs of worried villagers. [[Karen Haywood]] stands near the fire, clutching a scarf as tears stream down her face. “Where’s Kevin?” she whispers, her voice trembling. The air is thick with despair as the villagers exchange fearful glances. [[Errol Niles]] steps forward, his satchel clutched tightly, his eyes filled with both fear and resolve. “I think I can help,” he says, his voice unsteady but determined.

**Errol’s Information:**  
In both setups, Errol delivers the following:

- His brief contact with [[NPC The Town's Librarian - Rupert Niles|Rupert]], confirming that they are likely dealing with [[Caryth Nythis]], an ancient fey.
- The suggestion to visit [[Grimhold]], near [[Shadowcraig]], where fey hunter relics may provide an advantage.
- Supplies of **Wylderling Sandwiches**, granting **+2 Constitution saving throws for 1 hour** and **1d8 temporary hit points**.

**Narration Options:**

1. **If [[Errol Niles]] catches up to the party in the forest:**

> Heavy footfalls crunch in the snow behind you, and Errol Niles stumbles into view. His breath comes in ragged bursts, forming misty clouds in the freezing air. “I’m glad I caught up,” he says, his voice trembling. “I brought these.” He opens his satchel, revealing sandwiches wrapped in cloth. “You’ll need your strength.” He fidgets with a small stone engraved with runes. “I tried to contact my brother, Rupert—he’s the librarian in Mourn’s Folly—and he agreed. Caryth Nythis… that’s who this must be. She’s in the old records. An ancient fey, betrayed by mortals, now… well, she’s hunting again.” He hesitates, glancing at the snowy path ahead. “Grimhold… near Shadowcraig. The fey hunters stored relics there—tools they used to fight her kind. But…”
>
> He shifts uneasily, his breath still uneven. “There’s more,” he says after a moment, his voice quieter now. “She doesn’t just kill them. Not at first.” He pauses, his trembling hands tightening around the sending stone. “The records… they say she drains her victims slowly. Takes their life, their warmth. She twists it, makes it part of her magic.” He shudders, as though the thought alone has chilled him further.
>
> “The children…” His voice falters briefly before he steadies himself. “They’re not gone. Not yet. But the longer we take…” He doesn’t finish, his eyes darting back to the path ahead.
>
> After a long pause, he looks back at you, his expression a mix of fear and hesitation. “I need to get back to Brakenford. Karen—she’s doing everything she can to keep everyone calm, but the village needs me too.” His grip on the satchel tightens as his gaze lingers on the trail. “I’ll… leave it to you. You have what you need now.”

 If the party presses him to stay, his resolve falters.
 > “I… I don’t know if I’ll be much help,” he stammers, his shoulders slumping. “But… if you need me, I’ll come. Just… promise me we’ll save them.”

2. **If the party returns to [[Brakenford]]:**

> The Brakenford Hearth is filled with murmurs and weeping. Karen Haywood sits near the fire, clutching a scarf tightly as tears stream down her face. Nearby, villagers exchange hushed, worried words. The heavy silence is broken only by the crackle of the hearth and the occasional wail of the storm outside.
> 
> Errol Niles steps forward, holding a small stone engraved with runes, its faint glow fading. His hands shake slightly as he speaks, his voice low and uneven. “It’s her. It has to be,” he says, clutching the stone tighter. “Caryth Nythis… an ancient fey. Betrayed by mortals centuries ago, and now she’s… she’s feeding again.” He swallows hard, glancing at the storm outside. “The old records said she doesn’t just kill. She drains her victims, takes their life, their warmth, and twists it into her magic. That’s why she’s so dangerous. That’s why…” His voice trails off for a moment before he steadies himself.
> 
> “The fey hunters fought her kind before. They built tools, weapons—things meant to break her magic. That’s what’s in Grimhold. It’s near Shadowcraig, a vault hidden deep in the Crags. If we could get to it…” He shakes his head, uncertainty flickering across his face. “I know it could help, but it’s far. Time… we don’t have much of it.”
> 
> He glances at Karen, then back to the party, his expression conflicted. “I’m sorry. I wish I had more answers. I’ve read everything I could find. I even tried to reach Rupert—my brother—before the storm cut me off. He’s a librarian in Mourn’s Folly. He confirmed what I already knew, but…” Errol hesitates, lowering the stone. “This is my fault. I should’ve done more. I should’ve been ready.”
> 
> Before Errol can finish, a gruff voice cuts through the room. Mr. Fenwick steps forward, his face lined with anger and desperation. “We don’t have time, Errol,” he snaps, his voice trembling with barely contained emotion. “I know you mean well, but these are our children. We don’t have time for you to send the rescue party into a dungeon looking for trinkets!” He takes another step closer, his fists clenching at his sides. “She’s got my boys! She’s got our children!”
> 
> Murmurs of agreement ripple through the Hearth as other fathers nod, their faces grim. “Every moment we waste…” Mr. Fenwick’s voice cracks, and he turns to the party, his eyes pleading. “Please. Bring them back. Bring my boys back.”

### **Scene 2: The Choice**

The party reaches a critical decision point:

##### **Option 1: Path to Grimhold**

- The **[[Path to Grimhold]]** skirts the edge of the **[[Blackpine Thicket]]**, avoiding its magical dangers while leading to [[Grimhold]] at the base of **[[Shadowcraig]]**.

- **Next Steps**:
    - The party proceeds to [[Grimhold]] and resolves its challenges.
    - After completing [[Grimhold]], they automatically transition to **[[#**Scene 4 The Blackpine Edge**|Scene 4]]**, entering the [[Blackpine Thicket]] with the relics they’ve secured.

##### **Option 2: Direct Route Through the Forest**

- The party takes the direct path into the heart of the **[[Blackpine Thicket]]**, facing its magical dangers and growing corruption.

- **Next Steps**:
    - The party bypasses [[Grimhold]] entirely, continuing straight to **[[#**Scene 4 The Blackpine Edge**|Scene 4]]**, where their journey through the [[Blackpine Thicket]] begins.

**Clarification of Stakes**:

- **Option 1 (Grimhold)**:
    - Safer journey, side quest, to [[Grimhold]].
    - Acquire powerful relics but delay the pursuit of the children.

- **Option 2 (Direct Route)**:
    - Immediate pursuit of the children.
    - Greater risks from the forest’s dangers and fewer resources for the final confrontation.

---
###### Unified Flow
- **Option 1 (Grimhold)**: [[#**Scene 3 The Choice**|Scene 3]] → [[Path to Grimhold]] → [[Grimhold]] → [[#**Scene 4 The Blackpine Edge**|Scene 4]].
- **Option 2 (Direct Route)**: [[#**Scene 3 The Choice**|Scene 3]] →  [[#**Scene 4 The Blackpine Edge**|Scene 4]].

---

### **Scene 3: The Blackpine Edge**

- **Setup:** Regardless of the chosen path—whether the party went directly through the forest or detoured to [[Grimhold]]—they now arrive at the edge of the [[Blackpine Thicket]]. This marks the starting point for their final push toward Caryth Nythis’s lair in Act 3.

**Possible Scenarios Leading Here:**

1. The party followed the children’s tracks directly after the Frost Wolves fight and reached the Blackpine thickets edge.
2. The party returned to [[Brakenford]], regrouped, and then followed the path toward Caryth.
3. The party completed [[Grimhold]] and then traveled to the Blackpine Edge to proceed to Caryth.

**Narration (Read or Paraphrase):**

> The Blackpine Thicket looms before you, its towering, Black barked frost-covered trees standing as dark sentinels against the pale snow. The children’s tracks fade into long, shallow furrows in the snow, as if they were dragged deeper into the forest’s shadowy depths. The air feels unnaturally cold, heavy with an unshakable sense of foreboding. The forest ahead is still, save for the faint creak of frost-laden branches and the occasional distant whisper that seems to beckon you forward.

---

#### **Resolution of Act 2**

By the end of Act 2:

- The party has reached the edge of the [[Blackpine Thicket]].
- Their next decision will be to press deeper into the forest toward [[Caryth Nythis]]’s lair, beginning [[Act 3]].
