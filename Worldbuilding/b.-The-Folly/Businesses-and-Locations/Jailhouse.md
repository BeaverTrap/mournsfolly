### **Description**  

Mourn's Folly Jailhouse is a small, unassuming building near the center of town. With a stone foundation and weathered wooden walls, its barred windows and simple layout reflect the town's quiet nature. The jailhouse comprises:  

- **Constable's Office**: A plain wooden desk, shelves of record books, and a weapons rack holding Byron’s pistol and mace when off-duty.  
- **Holding Cell**: An iron-barred cell with a cot, bucket, and bench. Secure but rarely used.  
- **Storage Closet**: Contains ropes, shackles, and basic supplies, including Byron's emergency bag for a hasty exit.

The jailhouse mirrors Constable Byron Ward's practical yet minimal approach to law enforcement. It's functional for minor disturbances but ill-equipped to manage significant threats—an unease Byron feels as trouble brews in Mourn's Folly.

### **Lathander's Vigil: The Heirloom Pistol**

#### **Backstory**  
Lathander's Vigil, an intricately engraved pistol with a faint inner glow, was a gift to Cedric from his mentor, a devoted servant of the Morninglord. The weapon symbolizes faith, courage, and protection against darkness.  

One night, after Cedric ended up drunk in the jailhouse—a familiar incident in recent years—Byron took the pistol for safekeeping. The next morning, Byron denied any knowledge of the weapon. Cedric, too groggy to recall the night, harbors doubts but has no proof.  

Now hidden in Byron’s possession, the pistol reflects Cedric’s wavering faith and Byron’s pragmatic disregard for the Morninglord's teachings.
