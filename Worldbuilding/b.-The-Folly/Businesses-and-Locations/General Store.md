### **Daytime Flavor Text**  

> **As you step inside, the warmth and smell of dried spices and herbs greet you.**  
> Shelves are lined with jars of preserves, cloth sacks of grain, and rows of canned goods. A display table to the right overflows with seasonal fruits, while fresh vegetables hang from hooks along the back wall. Townsfolk exchange gossip over baskets of eggs and packets of dried tea.  
> 
> The shopkeeper stands behind a polished wooden counter, their inviting yet sharp demeanor catching every detail. Transactions are smooth, and rumors are deftly woven into the chatter. The store hums with activity, blending shopping with socializing.

### **Nighttime Flavor Text**

> **The shop is dark, its windows faintly reflecting the glow of street lanterns.**  
> Through the glass, shadows stretch over shelves packed with goods. The air carries the lingering scents of dried herbs and old wood. Inside, shelves feel closer, and goods cast dim shadows in the faint light of a lantern or candle.  
> 
> The shopkeeper's counter sits deserted, their ledger still open as though they had just stepped away, leaving behind an eerie stillness. The occasional creak of a floorboard breaks the silence as if the space itself remembers the day's activity.
