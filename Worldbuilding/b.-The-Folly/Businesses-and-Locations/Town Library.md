> The Town Library stands as a quiet sanctuary in Mourn's Folly, its modest exterior betraying the wealth of knowledge within. Nestled along the main street, the library's faded sign creaks gently in the wind. Inside, the air is heavy with the scent of old parchment and leather, and every corner is steeped in a sense of timeless curiosity. Sturdy wooden shelves line the walls, crammed with books, scrolls, and documents spanning a range of topics, from local folklore to regional history. A heavy oak desk at the center serves as the Librarian's station, perpetually stacked with tomes, quills, and inkpots.

> Dim light filters through narrow windows, illuminating a cozy reading nook with mismatched chairs and a small table. Though the library is typically quiet, it carries an atmosphere of anticipation, as though every book waits patiently for its secrets to be uncovered.

The Librarian's meticulous nature ensures every item is carefully organized and cataloged. Borrowing a book is a privilege, not a right, and their sharp eyes ensure all materials are treated with the respect they deserve.

### **Library Card**

**Application Process:**  
Characters wishing to check out books must demonstrate their reverence for knowledge:

- **Skill Check:** Roll Intelligence (History) or Charisma (Persuasion) with a DC of 12.  
  - **Success:** A library card is granted, allowing books to be borrowed.  
  - **Failure:** Access is restricted to in-library use under the Librarian's watchful gaze.

**Resident Rule:**  
Residents already hold library cards but may forget them.

- **Luck Check (DC 10):** If successful, they have their card on hand. If failed, the Librarian requires them to reapply with the standard check.

### **Librarian's Lecture:**

> "Knowledge is power, and power demands respect. This library is not just a repository of words; it is a guardian of our past, a lantern for our future. Misplacing your card is not simply an inconvenience; it is a failure to honor the very essence of what binds us to our history. Treat it—and the knowledge it represents—with care."

### **Excerpts from *The Nocturne Codex*:**

> *"The creature that shuns the light is cursed by the dawn; its power wavers beneath the sun's rays. Beware, for in shadow, it is swift and unbound by mortal limits."*

> *"Holy relics, imbued with divine faith, repel the undead as flame repels moths. They cower before the light of gods, driven back by the conviction of the living."*

> *"The unyielding flow of running water bars the vampire's path, breaking its form and scattering its essence."*

> *"Silver, the metal of the moon, pierces their flesh and leaves festering wounds. Radiant magic, divine and pure, burns their corrupted souls."*

> *"Beware their gaze, which compels obedience, and their bite, which chains the soul to darkness. Their words are silk-laden snares—trust not the promises of the undead."*

---

### **Complications**

1. **Librarian's Vigilance:** Unsanctioned searches may lead to the Librarian expelling the characters or alerting the guards.  
2. **Enemies Emerge:** Word of their interest spreads, drawing the attention of thralls or even Barstow himself.

---

### **Success Outcome**

> Locating *The Nocturne Codex* unveils a treasure trove of knowledge: weaknesses of vampiric creatures, their aversion to light and faith, and ancient rites for their destruction. This book may hold the key to defending Mourn's Folly from the mansion's dark influence.
