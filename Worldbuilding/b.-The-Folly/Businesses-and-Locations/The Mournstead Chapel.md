### **Outside of Mournstead Chapel**

Standing quietly at the center of Mourn's Folly, **Mournstead Chapel** is an unassuming structure of weathered stone, its simplicity reflecting the humility of the town itself. Its modest steeple reaches just above the surrounding rooftops, crowned with a sun-shaped emblem crafted in polished brass that catches the light at dawn. Ivy clings to the stone walls, and beneath a gently sloping roof, arched windows of frosted glass give the building a serene, almost ethereal appearance. A small garden blooms at its entrance, filled with hardy herbs and bright marigolds that thrive under Lathander's blessing. The chapel's wooden doors, carved with symbols of the rising sun, seem to welcome all who approach, offering a silent promise of warmth and peace within.

### **Inside of Mournstead Chapel**

The inside of **Mournstead Chapel** is warm and inviting, with wooden pews lined up along a central aisle, each polished smooth from years of use. The light filters softly through the frosted glass windows, casting gentle, shifting patterns across the stone floor. At the front of the room stands a simple altar draped in white cloth, upon which rests a carved sunburst symbol representing Lathander's light. Brass sconces line the walls, ready to be lit in the evenings, casting a golden glow that fills every corner. The air is tinged with the faint scent of lavender and cedar, calming and timeless.

Above the altar, a single, large window lets in the morning sun, illuminating the room in warm tones at dawn, a fitting tribute to the god of light and renewal. Wooden benches and small tables line the walls, where visitors leave small offerings or notes of gratitude and prayer. The atmosphere is one of reverence and simplicity, where even the smallest whisper feels like a sacred act, and every detail reminds visitors of Lathander's gentle presence, promising hope and new beginnings.

## **The Chapel**

**Mournstead Chapel**—lovingly referred to by townsfolk as the *Temple of the Dawn*, *House of the Rising Sun*, and *Lathander's Light*—sits at the heart of Mourn's Folly. It's a modest yet cherished place of worship, simple and humble, reflecting the values of the town and their reverence for Lathander, god of dawn and renewal. Though small in size, the chapel holds a powerful warmth, embodying Lathander's teachings of hope, healing, and new beginnings.

Lathander, often called the Morninglord, is the god of light, spring, and rebirth. His followers believe he ushers in every sunrise, lifting the shadows of night and offering each new day as a chance to begin again. To the people of Mourn's Folly, honoring him requires no grand display; instead, they show devotion through small acts of kindness, resilience, and creativity—qualities they see as embodying Lathander's gentle grace.

In troubled times, the chapel serves as a sanctuary. Townsfolk gather not just to worship, but to share burdens, seek healing, and find encouragement. The chapel stands humbly, much like the god it honors, as a steadfast light against the darkness—a place where even the most weary can find solace and the reassurance that every dawn brings new possibilities.

#### **Sermons of Light**

*"Lathander, our Dawnbringer, brings with him each morning a renewal, a reminder that each day can be a step closer to the light. In the darkest of nights, remember, dawn always returns. As long as we keep faith, so too will Lathander keep us in his sight."*

*"When we lose sight of hope, we forget that the dawn is not a distant wish but a promise. In every shadow, there is a sliver of light waiting to break through, if only we look for it."*

*"Our strength is not only in the promise of a new day but in the courage to hold that promise when the darkness seems endless. We are Lathander's own light-bearers, standing firm against despair."*

#### **Personal Reflections**

**Entry: Morning Doubts**  
*"How hollow my words feel these days. I preach of hope, of Lathander's light, yet my heart grows colder with each prayer. The nights seem to stretch longer, the dawn's promise further away. I cannot admit this to my congregation, nor to myself, but in the quiet hours, doubt gnaws at me. If only I could feel his warmth as I once did."*

**Entry: Alone in Faith**  
*"There was a time when I felt Lathander's presence, like a hand on my shoulder guiding me. Now, my prayers echo back emptily. I wonder if the darkness in this town is too thick for his light to reach. Is it my faith that has weakened, or has he turned his gaze from me?"*

**Entry: Crisis of Spirit**  
*"Today, I stumbled over my own words, a sermon turned to ramblings. I feel like an imposter, preaching strength in faith while mine crumbles beneath me. Perhaps Lathander has abandoned me as I've abandoned my belief. And if that's true, then what protection do I truly offer to my flock in Mourn's Folly?"*

**Entry: Lathander's Vigil Lost**  
*"How foolish of me, to hold onto such resentment over the loss of a single pistol. It is but a weapon, metal and powder, yet it gnaws at my thoughts daily as if it were a lost soul itself. In my clearer moments, I see how Byron could not be to blame. He's never taken to the Light, never shared my path—but he's no thief. Still, every time I catch sight of him, that dark whisper insists otherwise. It is a shameful thought, a weakness I cannot seem to shed. I've prayed, time and again, for Lathander's guidance to release this doubt. And yet, the Vigil's absence feels more like a wound in me than an object misplaced. The guilt hangs heavier each night, especially as I take to that blasted flask. Lathander, forgive me. Is it so hard to believe that my failing memory in that night of drink could have betrayed me, that I simply lost it as I did my senses? I can almost feel my mentor's disappointment, echoing through the shadows of each prayer. I must find peace with this. It was my failure, not his. And still... the thought lingers."*

**Entry: A Bitter Sacrament**  
*"I speak of strength in the face of shadows, yet tonight I found myself reaching not for my prayer book but for the flask hidden under my robes. A sip here and there, to calm the nerves, or so I tell myself. But Lathander sees all, doesn't he? If he does, I wonder if he's disappointed. It's become my private solace, the bitter warmth that keeps my own darkness at bay. I preach of light, yet I drink to forget the darkness within."*

**Entry: Failing the Flock**  
*"Another night, another sermon given with the taste of brandy on my breath. It's harder to keep the faith than it is to keep my hand from the bottle. My parishioners expect strength, yet I can barely muster the will to look them in the eye. I drown my doubts, hoping they'll disappear. But no matter how many drinks I take, they remain, lurking in the back of my mind like a shadow cast by an unseen light."*

**Entry: A Slipping Grip**  
*"My flask is lighter tonight, but so am I. Lathander's dawn comes with judgment as well as mercy, and I fear both. If my congregation knew... if anyone knew. I was supposed to be the beacon of hope in this town, the unshakable rock. And yet here I am, weakened and wavering, leaning on spirits that can't save me. I feel my grip slipping, on the bottle, on my faith, on myself."*

**Entry: One More Night**  
*"I've promised myself—again—that tomorrow will be different. That I'll put down the drink and return to the man I once was. But as the shadows lengthen, the flask finds its way back into my hand. Is it failure or comfort? I no longer know. All I know is that as my faith fades, the bottle grows heavier. How long can I keep hiding this from those who look to me for strength?"*
