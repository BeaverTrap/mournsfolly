title: Following the Cart
---


## Following or Intervening with the Cart

The PCs may notice Marlon Voss paying special attention to a large, ominous crate among the other deliveries. If they decide to follow the cart or intervene, they'll encounter challenges:

### Intervening Options

- **Distraction:**  
  PCs can distract the delivery men or Voss, requiring multiple successful rolls at DC 22 (Persuasion or Deception) to keep them occupied.

- **Stealth Check (DC 22):**  
  To tail the cart unseen, the PCs need to stay close without alerting the delivery men or Voss.

---

### Attempting to Unlock or Open the Crate

- **Thieves' Tools (DC 25):**  
  Lockpicking the crate is challenging, especially with Voss and the men nearby. PCs need continuous distractions to avoid being caught.

- **Strength Check (DC 22):**  
  Forcing the crate open requires a high roll. Failure risks detection.

> **If the Cart is Significantly Delayed:**  
> Should the PCs successfully stall the cart, a creature within begins stirring. The crate splinters, releasing a bat-like figure that escapes into the forest, vanishing into the night.

## Unseen Secrets in the Cellar

If the PCs shadow the delivery to Mournstead Mansion without intervening, they observe Marlon Voss leading the delivery men to the cellar doors. After carefully unloading the heavy crate, Voss murmurs a brief, reverent phrase in an unknown language. The air resonates subtly, as if awakening something dormant.

- Once the crate is placed in the cellar, Voss locks the doors with a heavy, ancient key. He whispers an incantation that causes a faint shimmer to form around the doorframe, creating an ethereal barrier.  
- This barrier is no ordinary lockâ€”it magically seals the room, obscuring sight and sound from both sides.

> PCs must remain hidden to avoid detection. Any sudden movements or sounds could draw unwanted attention.

### The Cellar Barrier

- **Magical Barrier:**  
  The magical lock on the cellar doors is a high-level arcane barrier. It prevents sound and magical scrying, rendering the cellar imperceptible from outside.

- **Investigation Check (DC 18):**  
  PCs examining the area can sense faint traces of magic, realizing that the barrier is far stronger than a standard lock.

## Stealthy Entry to the Cellar from Inside the Manor

The PCs arrive at the manor and face the challenge of sneaking in without alerting anyone inside. The front door is locked, but a few windows on the ground floor offer potential entry points.

### Front Door Lock (DC 15)

- **Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) Check (DC 15):**  
  PCs attempting to pick the lock need a successful Dexterity check. Failure may create noise, drawing Voss's attention. Success allows quiet entry.

---

### Finding the Cellar Entrance

Once inside, the atmosphere is thick with silence, broken only by faint echoes from below. PCs searching for the cellar spot a door hidden in an alcove, leading to a narrow staircase.

---

### Navigating the Stairway Trap

The cellar stairway is narrow, with some steps removed to create a hidden drop. Knife points gleam faintly at the bottom, hinting at a deadly trap.

- **Perception Check (DC 12):**  
  Discerns the missing steps just as the PCs approach.

- **Investigation Check (DC 15):**  
  Clearly reveals the trap below.

---

### Rope Descent and Stealth

- **Dexterity Check (DC 10) to Tie a Rope Securely:**  
  PCs can anchor a rope for a controlled descent. Failing this check may cause noise or movement, alerting anyone nearby.

- **Dexterity (Acrobatics) Check (DC 13):**  
  A careful descent avoids the deadly knives at the bottom.

---

## Observing the Ritual

Successfully entering the cellar undetected gives PCs a glimpse of Voss preparing the crate while Barstow remains hidden.

- **Stealth Check (DC 18):**  
  PCs observing must remain quiet, or risk catching Voss's attention.
