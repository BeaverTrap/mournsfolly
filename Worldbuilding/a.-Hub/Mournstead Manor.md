**Ethelwyn Cott** (NPC), General Store Owner  

### **Location**  
Perched on a slight hill overlooking **Mourn's Folly**, the manor is an expansive, eerie estate visible from almost anywhere in town. Encircled by thick woods on one side and a weathered stone wall on the other, it feels both isolated and ever-present.

### **Exterior Description**  
> **Mournstead Manor looms on the hill, its stone facade weathered and darkened with age. Ivy snakes up the walls, clinging to crumbling stonework and cracked window frames. The once-grand estate is surrounded by rusted wrought-iron fencing, broken in places, adding to the air of decay. Despite recent renovations, parts of the roof remain visibly damaged, and the faded shutters creak in the wind. A winding, overgrown path leads through the iron gates to the front steps, lined with chipped carvings that seem reluctant to welcome visitors.**

### **Interior Description**  
**Ground Floor**  
> **Inside, the air is stale and damp, carrying the faint smell of aged wood and lingering dust. A grand staircase dominates the entry hall, its banister polished but the steps creaking ominously. Faded portraits line the walls, their blank stares uncomfortably piercing. The left side opens into a parlor, filled with draped furniture, while a dim dining room lies to the right. Crates marked with arcane symbols line the walls, hinting at recent activity despite the oppressive weight of years past.**

**Basement/Cellar Entrance**  
> **Hidden behind an old bookshelf at the back of the house, a narrow door leads to the cellar stairs. Each step creaks louder as the descent grows colder. The cellar carries signs of recent use: fresh scratches on the floor, a large, padlocked crate, and cryptic symbols painted on the walls. The iron door at the hall's end is sealed with heavy locks and radiates a faint, menacing energy.**

### **Key Locations within Mournstead Manor**

1. **The Parlor**  
   - A large room filled with antique furniture, draped in dusty cloths. A grand piano sits untouched in a corner, and a tall bookcase conceals the hidden cellar entrance.

2. **The Dining Room**  
   - A long table dominates the room, its decaying tablecloth stained with remnants of forgotten meals. Crates and boxes fill the space, marked with cryptic symbols. Flickering light from a candelabra casts eerie shadows.

3. **The Cellar**  
   - Dark and oppressive, the cellar smells of damp stone. Wine racks and shelves sit empty, except for a reinforced crate near the stairs. The walls are painted with strange symbols, and the floor bears scratch marks as if something heavy was dragged. The room feels ancient and unnervingly alive.

4. **The Library**  
   - A hidden upper-floor library with shelves of books on various topics, including occult rituals, local legends, and the history of Mournstead. The windows are etched with faint symbols, permanently latched shut. Secrets of the town and manor lurk within these faded tomes.

5. **The Upstairs Rooms**  
   - The second floor houses a series of bedrooms, all eerily silent. Dust and cobwebs coat the furniture, and many windows are boarded up, admitting only faint slivers of light.

### **Atmosphere and Events**

- **Creeping Dread**  
  Every room carries an unsettling sense of being watched. Echoing whispers and faint scratching noises float through the halls, just beyond sight.

- **Subtle Unsettling Details**  
  Portraits seem to watch guests, and reflections in mirrors occasionally show flickers of movement.

- **Occasional Paranormal Hints**  
  Doors close suddenly, small objects shift or fall, and shadows stretch unnaturally. Guests may feel drained or fatigued, as if the manor itself saps their strength.
