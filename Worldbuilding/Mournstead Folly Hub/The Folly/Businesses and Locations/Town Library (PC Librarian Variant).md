title: Town Library (PC Librarian Variant)
---



**Library Description:**  
The Town Library remains largely the sameâ€”a quiet, musty sanctuary where the knowledge of Mourn's Folly is meticulously preserved. However, when the Librarian is a PC, they take on a more dynamic role, choosing how and when to share the library's resources and their own expertise with the party.

The library serves as both their base of operations and a reflection of their personality, with a mix of carefully curated tomes and signs of their current research projects scattered throughout. The PC Librarian's choices will shape how much the party learns and when.

### **Library Card Process for PCs**

When the Librarian is a PC, they determine whether to allow other characters access to the library's books.

- **DC Requirements Adjusted by the PC Librarian:** The party must convince the Librarian to lend them certain tomes or allow unrestricted access. The PC Librarian sets the tone for this process, which could include roleplay, skill checks, or proof of trustworthy intentions.  
- **Investigation Assistance:** If the party chooses to research independently, the Librarian can guide them, granting **advantage on Investigation checks** in the library.

### **What the PC Librarian Knows About Vampires**

A PC Librarian would inherently know certain facts about vampiric lore based on their studies and personal interest in the supernatural. The following information is at their disposal and can be shared at their discretion:

#### **Inherent Knowledge**

1. **Weaknesses:**
   - Vampires are vulnerable to radiant damage, silvered weapons, running water, and sunlight.  
   - Holy symbols repel them if wielded with conviction, though they must be genuinely blessed or imbued with divine power.

2. **Behavior:**
   - Vampires are highly intelligent and manipulative, often using charm to sway or dominate their prey.  
   - They are territorial, fiercely guarding their lairs and any thralls under their control.  
   - Vampires cannot enter a residence without an invitation.

3. **Thralls and Spawn:**
   - A vampire's thralls retain some of their humanity but are bound to serve their master's will.  
   - Newly turned vampire spawn are feral and bloodthirsty, but with time, they may develop greater intelligence and autonomy.

4. **Legends Specific to Mourn's Folly:**
   - The *Nocturne Codex*, rumored to be in the library's collection, holds detailed accounts of vampiric rituals and weaknesses.

#### **Roleplay Hooks for Sharing Knowledge**

- **Personal Interest:** The Librarian may already be intrigued by the mansion's mysteries, making them eager to share what they know.  
- **Withholding for Safety:** The Librarian might withhold information until they are convinced the party can handle the danger, creating tension or the need for persuasion.  
- **Curiosity-Driven Motivation:** They might agree to help if the party aids them in uncovering more about the mansion, its artifacts, or Barstow's history.

### **The Nocturne Codex**

If the Librarian is a PC, they may already be familiar with *The Nocturne Codex* or know where it is located within the library.

- They can choose to share direct excerpts or guide the party to uncover it themselves, fostering collaborative gameplay.
