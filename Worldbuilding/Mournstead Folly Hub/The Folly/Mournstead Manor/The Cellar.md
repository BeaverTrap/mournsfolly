title: The Cellar
---

---

The cellar of Mournstead Manor is dark, damp, and unsettling. Inside the house, the first few steps leading down appear intact, but beyond those, the staircase abruptly ends. The stairs have been carefully removed, and in their place, the wooden planks have been disassembled and laid out on the cellar floor below, embedded with various knives, tools, and other sharp objects. Anyone descending without caution or light would drop directly onto this makeshift trap, risking serious injury. Without darkvision or a bright light source, characters are unlikely to notice the missing stairs or the deadly setup below.

The air is heavy and bitterly cold, with a faint scent of mildew and an ancient, feral quality to it. Alongside a few dusty wine racks and empty shelves, a large, reinforced crate sits near the base of the stairs, flanked by smaller, tightly sealed containers stacked against the walls.

Faded, irregular symbols cover the stone walls, enhancing the room's eerie atmosphere. The floor surrounding the crate is marked with deep scratches, as though something large and heavy had been dragged across it recently. The room holds a foreboding presence, an aura that feels tangible in the silence.

A second entryway, the back cellar entrance, leads down from a cement staircase outside the house. These doors are secured with a thick padlock and an arcane ward, which prevents any sound or sight from passing through, rendering the entrance nearly impossible to breach from either side without a key or magical intervention.
