>Mourn's Folly is a small, secluded town with a population of around 300. Nestled between mist-laden woodlands and rolling hills, the town has a timeless quality, with cobbled streets, sturdy stone buildings, and a calm, almost sleepy atmosphere. Life here moves at a slower pace, with townsfolk living in close-knit harmony, grounded by long-held traditions and a strong sense of community.
>
> The town square is the heart of daily life, featuring a weathered stone fountain and an ancient oak where locals gather to exchange news. The general store, blacksmith, and a few humble shops provide essentials, while the modest *Mournstead Chapel* stands as a quiet place of faith and peace, embodying the Folly's humble spirit.
>
> The people of Mourn's Folly know each other by name, and even small events ripple through the town. Its misty edges and quiet streets make it a place of simple contentmentâ€”yet there's an unspoken allure to the Folly, with its hidden corners hinting at stories waiting to be told.
