Grimhold is an ancient, heat-bound dungeon created by a secretive order to protect their most treasured relics and hidden knowledge. Situated in the jagged peaks of Shadowcraig, this meticulously crafted structure of treated **[[Emberstone]]** stands as a stark contrast to the frostbitten wilderness surrounding it. Designed as both a fortress and a trial, its fiery defenses serve as a powerful counter to the frostbound fey the order once sought to defeat. Each room within Grimhold presents a distinct challenge, rewarding those who prove their worth with tools and knowledge essential for confronting the greater dangers that lie ahead.

---

## **Room 1: The Emberstone Gate**

#### **Description for the DM:**

The approach to Grimhold begins at a dome-shaped structure made of smooth black Emberstone, its glowing veins radiating a faint warmth that keeps the snow at bay. The single doorway leads to a small interior chamber, where a short staircase spirals down into the heart of the dungeon. At the bottom of the staircase, the Emberstone Gate awaits—a massive stone door etched with fiery runes, both inviting and foreboding. The gate serves as the dungeon's first line of defense, requiring cunning, strength, or a test of resolve to proceed.

---

#### **Challenge:**

The Emberstone Gate’s defenses can be bypassed using intellect, brute strength, or combat.

- **Arcana (DC 14)**: Decipher the fiery runes, identifying and activating the correct sequence to unlock the door.
- **Strength (DC 16)**: Force the door open, but this brute approach triggers the guardian’s activation.
- **Trap Effect (if triggered)**: If the sequence is solved incorrectly or the party opts for brute force, the **Blazing Sentinel** activates. This fiery construct must be defeated before entry is allowed.

---

#### **Guardian: The Grimstone Sentinel**

The [[Grimstone Sentinel]] is a humanoid construct forged entirely from treated **[[Emberstone]]**, a black stone threaded with glowing orange veins naturally found in the **[[Shadowcraig]]** mountains. While Emberstone is not unique to Grimhold, its deliberate treatment and expert craftsmanship here set it apart. The glowing veins pulse faintly with heat, their controlled warmth a testament to the ancient order’s mastery of its properties.

When activated, the Sentinel's surface erupts in flames, and the glowing veins shine brightly, radiating intense heat. This construct was designed to defend **[[Grimhold]]** from unworthy intruders, its fiery abilities a perfect counter to frost-bound fey or adventurers ill-prepared for the dungeon’s fiery defenses. Its towering form and burning presence serve as both a deterrent and a final test for those who approach the **Emberstone Gate**.

---

#### **DM Notes**

- The treated **[[Emberstone]]** used in Grimhold ensures a warm and dry area around the dungeon, creating a stark and unsettling contrast to the icy wilderness of **[[Shadowcraig]]**. The heat radiates outward, melting snow in a perfect radius and giving the structure an unnervingly pristine appearance.
- Success with an **Arcana (DC 14)** check allows the party to peacefully deactivate the gate's defenses, rewarding clever problem-solving and avoiding combat.
- Failure or brute force triggers the **Grimstone Sentinel**, offering a combat-focused challenge directly tied to Grimhold’s fiery theme and the order’s mastery of Emberstone.

#### **Narration (Read or Paraphrase)**

**Approaching the Gate:**

> As you navigate the jagged cliffs, the frozen expanse gives way to something wholly unnatural: Grimhold. Its smooth black walls, streaked with glowing veins of Emberstone, gleam faintly in the dim light. The snow stops abruptly as you approach, leaving the ground bare and dry, as though the winter chill itself is repelled by the dungeon’s heat.

> At the heart of the structure lies a massive stone door, its surface etched with fiery runes that shift and pulse like a living flame. The warmth radiating from Grimhold is almost comforting at first, but the closer you get, the more oppressive it feels, as if the structure itself is alive and watching.

---

**Triggering the Guardian:**

> The fiery runes flare with a sudden brilliance, their sequence disrupted. A deep, resonant hum reverberates through the air as the veins of Emberstone embedded in the walls blaze brightly. From the glowing stone, a humanoid figure begins to emerge, its body formed entirely of molten black rock streaked with burning orange veins. Flames ripple across its surface as it takes its first steps, the heat radiating outward in waves. The Grimstone Sentinel stands before you, its burning fists raised in challenge, ready to defend the dungeon from intruders.

## **Room 2: The Room of Restraint**

### **Description for the DM:**

This room is deceptively simple, designed to test patience and fortitude. The Emberstone veins embedded in the walls pulse faintly, glowing brighter as the room heats up. The only feature of note is an inscription carved above a solid, unyielding door: **“Only those who endure may pass.”** The air grows progressively hotter, creating an oppressive atmosphere that seems to press down on the players, testing their resolve.

---

### **Challenge:**

The players must resist the urge to act impulsively. The room rewards restraint and penalizes rash actions.

1. **Initial Setup:**
    
    - When the players enter, the door seals shut behind them, locking with a loud _clang_.
    - The room feels warm initially, but the temperature steadily rises, creating an increasingly oppressive heat.

2. **Key Elements:**
    
    - **The Inscription:** The phrase "Only those who endure may pass" is etched above the door. An **Investigation (DC 12)** or **Insight (DC 13)** check reveals that this is both literal and figurative: the party must wait and endure the heat to proceed.
	
    - **The Emberstone Veins:** Glowing veins of treated **Emberstone** line the walls. These veins are reactive to movement and force, flaring dangerously if triggered.

3. **How to Succeed:**
    
    - **Enduring the Heat:** The party must remain calm and avoid taking actions that escalate the room's defenses. After 3 minutes (or roughly 3 rounds in a tense setup), the door unlocks on its own.
	
    - **Skill Check for Clarity:** A **Perception (DC 14)** or **Arcana (DC 15)** check reveals that the Emberstone veins react to motion or force. Success clues the players into the passive nature of the challenge.

4. **What Triggers the Room:**
    
    - **Brute Force Attempt:** Any attempt to break down the door or force it open triggers the Emberstone veins to lash out with bursts of flame, dealing **2d6 fire damage** to all creatures within 10 feet of the door.
	
    - **Unnecessary Movement:** Excessive movement (e.g., pacing or frantically searching) causes the heat to rise faster, forcing **Constitution Saving Throws (DC 13)** against **Exhaustion**.

---

### **Complications:**

1. **Rising Heat:**
    
    - Each round that the players act impulsively (e.g., moving too much, attempting to force the door), the room’s temperature increases.
    - **Constitution Saving Throw (DC 12):** Players must succeed or gain **1 level of Exhaustion**.
    - The heat affects all creatures, including those with fire resistance (though they have advantage on saving throws).

2. **Flare Response:**
    
    - The Emberstone veins react violently to brute force or magic targeting the door.
    - A fiery burst lashes out, dealing **2d6 fire damage** in a 10-foot radius centered on the triggering player. All creatures in the radius must make a **Dexterity Saving Throw (DC 14)** to halve the damage.

---

### **DM Notes:**

- The challenge is psychological as much as physical. Players may instinctively try to "solve" the room, but the solution is patience and endurance.
- Provide subtle clues through descriptions of the heat intensifying in response to motion or force. For example:
    - “The veins of Emberstone along the walls pulse brighter as you move, their glow now accompanied by faint cracks of heat rippling through the air.”
- Make the players feel the oppressive heat through narration, emphasizing the difficulty of staying calm.
- If the players remain still and patient for 3 minutes (or 3 rounds), the door unlocks with a low rumble, allowing them to proceed.

---

### **Narration (Read or Paraphrase):**

**Upon Entering the Room:**

> As the door behind you slams shut, the air immediately grows warmer. The walls of the circular chamber pulse faintly with the glow of Emberstone veins, casting the room in an orange light. Above the only exit, a phrase is etched into the stone: _“Only those who endure may pass.”_ The temperature continues to rise, the warmth seeping into your skin, pressing down like a heavy weight. The room seems alive, watching, waiting for your next move.

**Clue for Remaining Still:**

> As you move or inspect the door, the Emberstone veins respond, their glow intensifying. The air grows hotter, and a faint hum begins to resonate through the chamber, as if warning against further action. The phrase above the door lingers in your mind: _“Only those who endure may pass.”_

**If the Players Act Rashly:**

> The Emberstone veins flare brightly, casting the room in blinding light. The heat becomes unbearable as a burst of fire lashes out from the walls, scorching the air around you. The room’s defenses are unrelenting, punishing your every move.

**When the Door Unlocks:**

> A deep, resonant _clang_ echoes through the room as the door slowly swings open. The oppressive heat subsides, leaving the Emberstone veins dim and dormant once more. The way forward is clear.

---

### **Outcome:**

- **Success (Remaining Calm):** The party avoids unnecessary damage and Exhaustion, learning the importance of restraint for future challenges.

- **Failure (Acting Rashly):** The party suffers damage and potential Exhaustion but can still proceed after enduring the room’s defenses.


Here’s the updated **Room 3: The Ember Vein Gauntlet**, incorporating the revised **Emberstone Spark Swarm** mechanics and the new elements like traps, chain reactions, and the decoy door:

---

## **Room 3: The Ember Vein Gauntlet**

#### **Description for the DM:**

This long hallway is filled with traps and swarms of [[Emberstone Spark|Emberstone Sparks]], designed to test the party's ingenuity and observation. The hallway appears to lead to a massive stone door at the far end, glowing faintly with Emberstone veins, but this is a decoy. The actual exit is a hidden passage halfway down the hallway, disguised as part of the polished Emberstone walls.

---

#### **Challenges:**

The room provides both environmental hazards and combat opportunities, emphasizing problem-solving over brute force.

1. **Decoy Door and Hidden Exit:**
    
    - The decoy door at the end of the hallway is an elaborate ruse. Attempts to open it trigger additional traps and spawn **2d4 Emberstone Sparks**.
    - **Perception (DC 15)** or **Investigation (DC 14)**: Detect the hidden exit halfway down the hallway, disguised within the Emberstone-lined walls.

2. **Traps Along the Hallway:**
    
    - **Pressure Plates:** Stepping on hidden plates triggers a series of flame jets.
        - **Dexterity Saving Throw (DC 14):** Avoid the flames or take **2d6 fire damage**.
    - **Arcana (DC 14)** or **Thieves' Tools (DC 12):** Disable the plates.

3. **Swarms of Emberstone Sparks:**
    
    - Each triggered trap or failed skill check spawns **1d4 Emberstone Sparks**.
    - Sparks are fragile but explode when hit, dealing **1d6 fire damage** to creatures within 5 feet.
    - The swarm grows with repeated alerts, escalating the threat.

---

#### **Avoiding Combat Entirely:**

- If the party can detect the hidden exit early and move stealthily, they can bypass most of the hazards.
- **Stealth (DC 14):** Avoid triggering traps and alerting the Sparks. Success allows the party to exit undetected.

---

#### **Narration (Read or Paraphrase):**

**Entering the Gauntlet:**

> The long hallway stretches before you, its polished Emberstone walls glowing faintly with fiery veins. The warmth is oppressive, radiating from the floor and walls, making the air shimmer. At the far end, a massive stone door glows faintly, its intricate veins of Emberstone pulsing with light. The hallway appears deceptively simple, but an uneasy feeling settles in your chest as you take your first steps forward.

**Triggering a Trap:**

> A sharp click echoes through the hallway, followed by a sudden burst of heat. Flames erupt from hidden jets along the walls, their searing tongues licking at the air. At the same time, the Emberstone veins pulse brighter, and from the heat, small sparks of flame coalesce into swarming motes of fire. The Emberstone Sparks surge toward you, their fiery bodies crackling with explosive energy.

**Discovering the Hidden Exit:**

> As you examine the hallway more closely, you notice a faint imperfection in the polished wall. What first seemed like a solid surface reveals a faint outline, the glow of Emberstone subtly framing a concealed passage. The hidden door blends so seamlessly with the surrounding stone that it’s clear whoever built this place intended to mislead intruders.

---

#### **DM Notes:**

- The Ember Vein Gauntlet is designed to be as much about player creativity as skill checks. Encourage alternative solutions, such as:
    
    - Using spells like **Detect Magic** or **Dispel Magic** to locate or disable traps.
    - Employing area-of-effect spells to neutralize multiple **Emberstone Sparks** at once.
    - Using tools, like **Thieves' Tools**, to dismantle traps.

- Allow the party to realize the decoy door’s nature with a **successful Investigation (DC 16)** or after multiple failed attempts to open it. Reward their ingenuity in finding the hidden exit with reduced hazards.

## **Room 4: The Forge Guardian**

### **Description for the DM:**

The Forge Chamber is the heart of Grimhold, where treated **[[Emberstone]]** radiates its most intense heat. The room is dominated by a central forge that pulses with molten energy, and a towering **Molten Grimstone Guardian** stands ready to defend the secrets of Grimhold. Above, a jagged opening in the ceiling serves as a spawning point for Emberstone Sparks, small constructs that swarm the room when the guardian calls for aid. The **Emberstone Core**, embedded in the base of the forge, radiates immense heat and power. It is not only the source of the guardian’s energy but also a critical tool for future challenges.

---

### **Challenge:**

This room presents a combat-focused encounter with mechanics for strategic solutions. The players must overcome the **[[Molten Grimstone Guardian]]**, manage swarms of Sparks, and either weaken or carefully extract the **[[Emberstone Core]]**.

#### **Core Mechanics:**

1. **The Guardian Awakens:**  
    Upon entering the chamber, the **Molten Grimstone Guardian** activates, its molten body radiating intense heat. It immediately moves to attack intruders.
    
2. **Swarming Emberstone Sparks:**
    
    - A jagged opening at the top of the chamber begins to glow, and **1d4+1 Emberstone Sparks** swarm into the room as the guardian’s lair action each round.
    - The Sparks harass players with low-damage attacks but create chaos in numbers.
    - **Destroying the Opening:** Players can target the swarm source by identifying the jagged opening and using ranged attacks or spells to block or collapse it.
        - **Perception (DC 15):** Spot the opening as the source of the Sparks.
        - **Attack the Opening (AC 14, HP 20):** Collapsing the opening ends the swarm mechanic.

3. **Emberstone Core (Key Mechanic):**  
    The **[[Emberstone Core]]** is a critical part of the encounter, serving as both the guardian’s power source and a future tool. Instead of destroying the core outright, the party must weaken and extract it.
    
    - **Investigation (DC 17):** Identify weak points in the core’s containment.
    - **Arcana (DC 15):** Understand the core’s function and determine how to safely extract it.
    - **Melee Attack (AC 15, HP 15):** Weaken the core’s structure without shattering it.
        - When reduced to **0 HP**, the core’s energy flares brightly, stunning the guardian and ending the fight. The core remains intact, ready for extraction.

4. **Environmental Hazards:**
    
    - **Molten Floor:** Sections of the floor glow with heat, forcing players to avoid stepping in them. Entering these areas requires a **Dexterity Saving Throw (DC 14)** or take **1d6 fire damage**.
    - **Lashing Emberstone Veins:** Striking the forge or walls causes veins to lash out, dealing **1d6 fire damage** to creatures within 5 feet.

---

### **Outcome:**

1. **Victory Through Combat:**
    
    - Players defeat the **Molten Grimstone Guardian** through traditional combat. The forge dims, and the party proceeds to **Room 5: The Treasure Room**.
    - The **[[Emberstone Core]]** can still be extracted post-combat.

2. **Victory Through Clever Play:**
    
    - Players weaken and safely extract the **[[Emberstone Core]]**, disabling the guardian without prolonged combat.
    - The core is stored as a magical item, usable for bypassing Caryth’s ice golem or empowering the party during the final confrontation.

---

### **Narration**

**Entering the Room:**

> The chamber radiates unbearable heat, the air rippling with waves of molten energy. At its center, a massive forge blazes with Emberstone veins that glow like molten rivers. Towering before the forge stands a hulking construct, its body carved from black stone and streaked with fiery veins of molten Emberstone. Above, a jagged opening in the ceiling glows faintly, a faint hum building in intensity as sparks begin to rain down.

**Spotting the Emberstone Core:**

> The base of the forge glows with a fiery brilliance, a pulsating node of molten light embedded within its structure. The **Emberstone Core** radiates with immense heat, its veins pulsing in rhythm with the guardian’s movements. It hums with untapped potential, its energy both a threat and a potential boon.

**Triggering Core Extraction Success:**

> Your final strike lands true, cracking the surface of the **Emberstone Core**. Its fiery veins flare brilliantly, and the guardian freezes mid-stride, its molten frame hardening into inert stone. The forge sputters and dims as the core pulses faintly, weakened but intact, its power waiting to be unleashed.

**Collapsing the Opening:**

> The ceiling trembles as your attack strikes the glowing opening. With a deafening crack, a cascade of stone and molten debris seals the hole, cutting off the flow of Emberstone Sparks. The swarming constructs flicker and fade, their energy dissipating as their source is destroyed.

---

### **DM Notes:**

- The **[[Emberstone Core]]** is central to the encounter’s stakes and rewards, tying the dungeon to the larger narrative.
- The ability to disable the swarm source through clever tactics adds variety and keeps the encounter dynamic.
- The environmental hazards create a sense of urgency without overwhelming the party.


## **Room 5: The Treasure Vault**

### **Description for the DM:**

The final room of Grimhold is a sanctuary of knowledge and relics, reflecting the values of the ancient sect of the **Order of Veiled Truths**. Shelves of scrolls and tomes line the walls, each detailing forgotten lore, strategies, and the order’s eternal battle against frostbound foes. At the center of the room stands a polished stone altar, glowing faintly with Emberstone veins, holding relics of immense power. The **Emberstone Core**, now extracted from the forge, is given special instructions for its proper use in future encounters.

---

### **Challenge:**

This room is primarily narrative-driven, with opportunities for discovery and roleplay. A light hazard or puzzle protects the relics.

#### **Core Features:**

1. **The Relics:**
    
    - The altar contains the following:
        - **Emberstone Core:** A glowing core of treated Emberstone that radiates immense heat and power. An engraved plaque at the base of the altar provides instructions for its use, emphasizing its role in bypassing Caryth’s ice golem or countering her frost-based abilities.
        - **Hunter’s Blade:** A silvered longsword that deals an additional **1d6 radiant damage** to fey and undead creatures.
        - **Ward of Warming:** A magical amulet that grants immunity to cold damage for 1 hour once per day.
        - **Scroll of Emberflame:** A one-time-use spell scroll that casts **Wall of Fire**.

2. **Scrolls and Tomes:**
    
    - Ancient writings line the shelves, written in a combination of Common and the order’s cipher.
    - Key contents include:
        - **Detailed Instructions on the Emberstone Core**: Warnings, potential uses, and its strategic importance in fighting frost-based threats.
        - **Connection to the Order:** Hints that this sect was an ancient branch of the **Order of Veiled Truths**, with shared goals and practices.
        - **Lore on Caryth Nythis:** Descriptions of her kind, past battles with similar entities, and potential strategies for the coming encounter.
    - If **[[Errol Niles]]** is present, he may recognize the cipher and make connections:
        - **Insight or Arcana (DC 13):** Errol reveals the connection between this sect and the **Order of Veiled Truths**, marveling at the preserved knowledge and its potential to aid in the coming battles.



---

### **Narration (Read or Paraphrase)**

**Entering the Vault:**

> The final door creaks open, revealing a chamber of serenity and warmth. Polished black stone walls streaked with glowing veins of Emberstone cast a dim, fiery light across the room. Shelves of ancient tomes and scrolls line the walls, their worn covers etched with sigils of the **Order of Veiled Truths**. At the center, a glowing stone altar holds relics of immense power. The calm of the chamber feels reverent, as though the air itself honors the treasures within.

**Discovery of the Scrolls:**

> The shelves are filled with writings in an ancient cipher, their glowing ink catching your eye. For those who can interpret them, the texts speak of the sect’s mission to combat frostbound horrors and protect the realm. One passage describes the **Emberstone Core**, detailing its use against frost-based enemies, including creatures like Caryth’s ice golem.

**Errol’s Insight (If Present):**

> Errol’s voice trembles as he scans the glowing script. “This... this is incredible. These writings—they’re from an ancient sect of the Order. Their mission, their knowledge—it’s still intact. And this...” He gestures toward the core. “This could tip the scales. They knew what they were facing. They prepared for this moment.”

**Triggering the Trap (Optional):**

> As your hand nears the relics, the sigils on the altar flare brightly. A sudden pulse of searing heat radiates outward, forcing you to shield your face. The warmth subsides as the light dims, the ward resetting with a faint hum.

---

### **Exiting the Dungeon**

At the far end of the room, a spiral staircase ascends, emerging near the edge of the **[[Blackpine Thicket]]**. The frozen wilderness contrasts sharply with the warmth of Grimhold, marking the party’s transition into the next phase of their journey.

---

### **DM Notes:**

- Encourage players to engage with the scrolls and tomes for deeper lore and connections to the **Order of Veiled Truths**.
- Use **[[Errol Niles]]** as a narrative tool to reveal the connection if he is present, making the party feel the weight of their discoveries.
- The **Emberstone Core** instructions should emphasize its importance in Caryth’s encounter, including bypassing her ice golem and suppressing her frost magic.
- The optional trap keeps players cautious but doesn’t overshadow the room’s narrative significance.
