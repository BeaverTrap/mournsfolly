The **Blackpine Thicket** is a sprawling forest that surrounds the base of the **[[Blackstone Crags]]**. Its towering, charcoal-barked trees—resembling ancient redwoods or sequoias—create a shadowed canopy that gives the forest an eerie ambiance even during the brightest days. The Thicket is both a source of life and a place of caution, as its depths hold both resources and dangers.

#### **Ecology**

- **Rare Flora**: Frost-resistant herbs, mushrooms, and medicinal plants thrive here, making it a vital resource for foragers like **[[Maren Brightleaf]]**.
- **Wildlife**: From harmless hares to prowling wolves, the forest supports a range of creatures adapted to its darkened landscape.

#### **Legends**

- **The Whispering Pines**: Tales persist of villagers hearing whispers from the trees, believed to be the voices of spirits who protect—or curse—the forest.
- **The Lost Grove**: A hidden glade deep within the Thicket is said to house ancient fey magic.
