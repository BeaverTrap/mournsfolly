The **Blackstone Crags** form the westernmost edge of the **[[Silvermaw Peaks]]**, a rugged expanse of jagged, shadowy formations that stand in stark contrast to the icy heights of the **[[Snowmantle Spires]]**. These dark peaks are rich in minerals, making them a valuable yet dangerous region for prospectors. The Crags are also home to hidden dangers, from crumbling rock faces to lurking predators that use the shadows to their advantage.

#### **Geography**

- The **[[Blackspire Summit]]**, visible from miles away, stands as the tallest and most prominent feature of the Crags, casting long shadows across the surrounding terrain.
- The **[[Shadowcraig]]**, with its jagged, frost-veined slopes, serves as another significant landmark within the Crags, marking the southern edge where the **[[Shattered Basin]]** begins.
- The **[[Blackpine Thicket]]** borders the base of the Crags, its dense forest providing both resources and hazards for those who dare to venture within.

#### **Legends**

- **Haunted Mines**: Lost miners and their spectral warnings are said to echo through abandoned shafts.
- **The First Explorers**: Stories tell of adventurers who sought the treasures of **[[Blackspire Summit]]**, only to be swallowed by the mountainâ€™s shadows.
