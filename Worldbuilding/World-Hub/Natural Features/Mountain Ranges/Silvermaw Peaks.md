The **Silvermaw Peaks** form a vast, rugged mountain range that encircles the Shattered Basin like the jaws of a great beast. Stretching from the icy grandeur of the **[[Snowmantle Spires]]** in the east to the shadowy **[[Blackstone Crags]]** in the west, the Silvermaw Peaks are a region of stark beauty and perilous terrain. Known for their mineral-rich mountains, towering summits, and diverse climates, the Peaks are both a vital resource and a formidable challenge for those who venture within.

#### **Geography**

- **To the East**: The **[[Snowmantle Spires]]**, crowned by the dazzling **[[Mount Silverglent]]**, are perpetually cloaked in snow and frost, their icy beauty a sharp contrast to the shadowed Crags.
- **At the Center**: The [[Shattered Basin]] lies cradled within the Silvermaw Peaks, a rugged expanse of fissures, ridges, and sparse vegetation.

- **[[Blackpine Thicket]]**: A vast forest surrounding the base of the Crags, where the bark of the massive trees appears as dark as charcoal.


#### **Ecology**

The Silvermaw Peaks are home to a wide variety of creatures, both mundane and magical. From hardy mountain goats to soaring griffons, the range teems with life adapted to its harsh conditions. The forested lower regions, such as the **[[Blackpine Thicket]]**, provide refuge for foragers and hunters, while the upper peaks remain a domain of danger and mystery.
