- **To the South**: The **[[Kendausk River]]** winds its way through the Basin, though frozen solid in winter, serving as the main trade route during warmer months.
- **At the Center**: The **Brekenford Hearth**, a monumental stone infused with glowing mineral veins, serves as the heart of the village. This building doubles as a communal gathering place and market hub, radiating warmth that sustains the village during its coldest months.
