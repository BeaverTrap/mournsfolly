Barstow is a vampire of unspeakable age, a harbinger of devastation who exists solely to feed on despair and obliterate the lives and communities in his path. He takes no interest in conquest or dominion; instead, he thrives on the ruin of towns and the collapse of the fragile bonds that hold societies together. Centuries of relentless destruction have transformed him into a grotesque and nightmarish figure, whose very presence instills terror and despair in those who encounter him.

While Barstow’s ultimate joy lies in devastation, the slaughter he leaves in his wake has made him unimaginably wealthy. His thralls plunder the remains of every town he destroys, offering up treasures, artifacts, and valuables to their master. Over the millennia, he has amassed vast troves of riches—yet these hold no meaning beyond serving as symbols of his endless ruin. Barstow’s monstrous visage and unyielding hunger reflect the sheer magnitude of the horrors he has wrought, cementing him as an eternal embodiment of fear and destruction.

- **Barstow’s Powers and Presence:**
    
    - Build his stat block with escalating challenges in mind:
        - At first, Barstow’s encounters could be indirect (e.g., visions, whispers, or controlled minions).
        - Introduce _lair actions_ tied to specific areas of Mourn’s Folly or regional locations.
        - Like Strahd, allow him to toy with the party (e.g., engaging in dialogue mid-battle or sparing them to "watch them grow").
- **Progression:**
    
    - As Barstow consumes the town, his power grows. Use milestones or the passage of time to represent his growing influence:
        - **Early Campaign:** Barstow is a shadowy manipulator, operating from the outskirts.
        - **Mid Campaign:** He’s openly a threat, turning NPCs into thralls or creating regional disasters.
        - **Late Campaign:** Barstow reaches his full power, forcing a final confrontation.

### **2. Town of Mourn’s Folly**

- **Dynamic NPCs:**
    - NPCs should have unique arcs tied to the campaign's progression:
        - Allies who can turn into enemies or vice versa.
        - Thralls and creatures directly linked to Barstow’s influence.
        - Personal stakes for the players (e.g., a family member or mentor is turned).
- **Encounters in the Town:**
    - Use the town’s physical and social spaces to create escalating challenges:
        - **Early Campaign:** Mysterious disappearances, strange behaviors, and subtle corruption.
        - **Mid Campaign:** Entire districts fall to Barstow’s influence, requiring daring infiltration.
        - **Late Campaign:** The town becomes a staging ground for Barstow’s forces.

---

### **3. Regional Exploration**

- Expand the areas surrounding Mourn’s Folly to include:
    - **Haunted Forests:** Tied to Barstow’s domain and filled with cursed beasts and foraging opportunities.
    - **Forgotten Ruins:** Dungeon crawls where players uncover lore about Barstow and find key artifacts.
    - **Village Outposts:** Other settlements impacted by Barstow’s corruption, each with unique challenges.

---

### **4. Integrating Dungeon Delicacies**

- Make food and harvesting a key part of survival:
    - **Foraging in Dangerous Biomes:** The corrupted land makes ingredients harder to find but more powerful.
    - **Rare Recipes:** Players uncover unique recipes that counteract Barstow’s magic or provide key advantages.
    - **Specialty Shops:** Include NPC chefs or vendors who offer tools, like enchanted cookware or preserved meats.

---

### **5. Barstow’s Growth as a Villain**

- Use milestones and interactions to show Barstow’s evolution:
    - **Phase 1: The Shadow:** Barstow manipulates events from the background, sending agents or influencing dreams.
    - **Phase 2: The Tyrant:** He starts corrupting the town openly, drawing players into confrontations.
    - **Phase 3: The Apex Predator:** Barstow becomes a full-fledged monstrous entity, reshaping reality in his domain.


### **Barstow’s Wealth and the Antiques Shop**

- **Backstory for Barstow’s Wealth:**  
    Barstow’s riches are the spoils of countless dead towns, amassed as his thralls scoured ruins for valuables. These treasures, stripped from the lifeless hands of his victims, are offerings to their master. Over the centuries, this has created an eerie legacy of lost artifacts and cursed items.
    
- **The Antiques and Curiosities Shop:**
    
    - Stocked with rare and strange items, many of which carry stories of their tragic origins.
    - Some items might even hint at the devastation of previous towns (e.g., a ledger from a destroyed settlement, a child’s toy broken in fear).
    - The shopkeeper could unknowingly—or knowingly—serve as a thrall or pawn for Barstow, subtly spreading his influence even before his arrival.

---

### **Delaying Barstow’s Arrival**

- **Why Delay?**  
    This approach gives the players time to bond, explore Mournstead Folly, and form attachments to its NPCs. The party can get a sense of safety and normalcy, which makes Barstow’s eventual arrival far more devastating.
    
- **Voss’s Role:**
    
    - **Disguised Intent:** Voss could act as a recruiter or manipulator for Barstow, but initially present himself as a **mysterious benefactor** or a morally gray local figure.
    - **The Task:** Voss sends the party to acquire an artifact or resource critical to Barstow's plans. The party believes they’re doing good, but the artifact could later become part of Barstow’s domination strategy.
    - **Subtle Hints:** NPCs might subtly question Voss’s intentions, or artifacts tied to Barstow might seem out of place but are dismissed as coincidence.

---

### **Early Campaign: Mournstead as a Hub**

- Use **Mournstead Folly** as a living, breathing town where the party interacts with NPCs, learns the systems, and becomes invested in the town’s fate.
- Introduce side quests, challenges, and systems (like Dungeon Delicacies) in a low-stakes environment to ground the party in the town’s rhythm.

#### **Key Town Features:**

- **NPC Interactions:** The party meets townsfolk with distinct personalities, such as the shopkeeper, the miller, or the librarian.
- **Foreshadowing:** Subtle hints of Barstow’s influence—strange whispers, eerie dreams, or mysterious visitors—create tension without revealing the full threat.
- **Dungeon Delicacies Integration:** Players learn to forage, cook, and harvest in their early quests, building familiarity with the system.

### **The Kobold Dungeon**

- **5-Room Dungeon Structure:**
    
    - **Room 1 (Entrance):** Traps and signs of kobold ingenuity (pressure plates, pit traps).
    - **Room 2 (Puzzle/Challenge):** A clever mechanism guarding the deeper lair, requiring problem-solving (e.g., redirecting light, activating pressure plates).
    - **Room 3 (Combat Encounter):** A room filled with kobold defenders using the terrain to their advantage.
    - **Room 4 (Climax/Artifact):** The artifact the party seeks is heavily guarded. Maybe it’s something the kobolds worship as sacred, heightening the moral dilemma.
    - **Room 5 (Escape):** Reinforcements arrive, or the players face traps designed to prevent intruders from leaving.
- **Outcome:**
    
    - The party retrieves the artifact but is instructed by Voss not to wipe out the kobolds, which raises questions about his motives.
    - The players witness the value of kobold harvesting but are limited in their ability to exploit it.

### **The Turned Kobolds (Post-Barstow Arrival)**

- **Vampiric Kobolds:**  
    When the party revisits the dungeon, they find the kobolds turned into terrifying vampiric minions of Barstow. Their traps are deadlier, their tactics more aggressive, and their appearance monstrous (e.g., glowing red eyes, elongated fangs).
- **Contrast with First Encounter:**  
    The shift highlights the devastating effect of Barstow’s influence and creates a narrative tie between the players’ early quest and the larger threat.
- **New Rewards:**  
    Harvesting from vampiric kobolds yields unique and dangerous materials, introducing new opportunities for crafting.
