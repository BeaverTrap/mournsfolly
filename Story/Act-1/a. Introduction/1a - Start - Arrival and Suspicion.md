### Daytime Exploration and Rumors

**Overview:**  
During the first day, the PCs can explore *Mourn's Folly*, where they have opportunities to gather supplies, shop for equipment, and learn about the town's local legends and personalities. Rumors about the mansion, Voss, and the mysterious Barstow circulate freely, piquing curiosity and sparking initial suspicions.

**Key Rumors to Discover:**

- **The Haunted Mansion**
  - *"Cursed Estate"*: Locals claim the Mournstead Mansion is cursed, and they avoid the place after sundown. Some say Edgar Mournstead's ghost lingers, mourning his lost family.
  - *Whispers of Spirits*: Rumor has it that some hear footsteps, murmuring voices, or see fleeting figures in the mansion's windows at night. A handful even believe the house has a presence that watches, listening for intruders.

- **Voss's Unusual Presence**
  - *"That Charming Outsider"*: Voss is recognized for his charm, yet townsfolk have noticed he's careful with details about himself. Those who pry are met with smooth deflections, always steering conversations away from personal matters.
  - *Frequent Shipments*: Voss's orders have increased, especially unusual items and shipments for the mansion. Workers say he's particular about how things are handled and insists certain crates go directly to the mansion's cellar.

- **The Mystery of Barstow**
  - *"The Absent Business Partner"*: While Voss speaks fondly of Barstow, most townsfolk haven't seen him. Voss explains Barstow's absence as "preoccupied with matters elsewhere." Speculations range from Barstow being reclusive to him suffering from some rare illness.
  - *Strange Affinity for Oddities*: A few who've overheard Voss mention Barstow's taste in "rare artifacts" say it goes beyond antiques. It's said he's interested in relics linked to dark, ancient legends—a peculiar interest that raises more eyebrows the longer he remains unseen.

- **Additional Colorful Town Gossip**
  - *"Accidents at the Manor"*: Workers restoring the mansion claim they've encountered accidents with no clear cause, like tools vanishing and sudden, unsettling chills in certain rooms.
  - *Connection to Edgar Mournstead*: Older locals claim Edgar Mournstead's tragic story is woven into the town's history, but more superstitious residents believe his restless spirit is why the mansion holds such a dark aura. Some claim Barstow's interest in the mansion is deeper than just an investment.

### Encouraging Preparations

Before sunset and the ship's arrival, PCs can stock up on gear or specific items they may need, guided by the rumors. Local shops offer a range of adventuring supplies—lanterns, ropes, holy symbols, and the occasional enchanted trinket—though the selection is modest, befitting a quiet town like Mourn's Folly. For characters who dig deeper into the rumors, Cedric, the town's priest, might recommend certain charms or holy symbols, noting they offer "peace of mind," especially given the mansion's ominous history.

**Goals:**

- **Engage PCs in Gathering Information and Supplies:** Allow players to explore and interact with the town's lore.
- **Spark Suspicion Around Voss and Barstow:** Through scattered gossip and eccentric activities, help the PCs form a vague, unsettling image of Barstow's unknown intentions.
- **Create Tension and Foreshadowing:** Leave enough ambiguity in the rumors to heighten unease and encourage investigation.

### The Crate's Mysterious Delivery

After sunset, around 6 p.m., the delivery ship arrives, bustling with goods for Mourn's Folly. As the cargo is unloaded, a particularly large, heavy crate garners Voss's close attention. Though the crate was originally bound for the antique shop, Voss quietly pays the delivery men extra to haul it up to the Mournstead Mansion. 

The delivery men, puzzled but eager for the bonus, reload the crate onto a cart and, with Voss's specific instructions, begin transporting it to the mansion's cellar entrance.

**Potential Player Actions:**
- Observe from the shadows to learn more about Voss’s behavior.
- Attempt to follow the cart stealthily to its destination.
- Interact with the workers or Voss to gather clues about the contents of the crate.

### Goals and Themes

- **Heighten Suspicion:** The PCs begin to understand that Voss and Barstow harbor dangerous secrets, laying the foundation for distrust and fear.
- **Introduce Barstow's Power:** This encounter foreshadows the chilling nature of Barstow's influence over others.
- **Encourage Stealth and Caution:** Whether the PCs attempt to stop the delivery, sneak into the cellar, or simply observe, emphasize the value of discretion when dealing with these dark figures.
