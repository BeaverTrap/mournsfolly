# 1 - Introduction to Mourn's Folly

### Mournstead Folly

Nestled quietly between misty woodlands and rolling hills, *Mournstead Folly*—known locally as *Mourn's Folly*—is a secluded, slow-paced town. Founded over a century ago by Edgar Mournstead, a former soldier seeking solace, it became a place where families valued community, family, and familiar traditions. Life in Mourn's Folly has always moved at a gentle pace, with little ever happening beyond the usual rhythms of small-town life. The townsfolk aren't wealthy, but they share a neighborly spirit, and most feel content in the simple, shared routines of each day.

Yet, Mourn's Folly has its shadows. Local lore says that Edgar's family vanished one night without a trace, leaving him alone and broken. Overcome by grief, he withdrew into his mansion, sealing himself off from the world. With each passing day, he slipped further into reclusion, shunning even the most well-meaning neighbors. The house, once a proud symbol of hope, decayed alongside him—its walls crumbling, windows darkened, and gardens overtaken by weeds.

As time passed, Edgar's presence faded from memory, and the townsfolk ceased their attempts to check on him. Some say he died quietly within those walls, while others whisper that he vanished like his family before him. Yet, no one ever found a body, nor a single clue to confirm his fate. His story became a part of Mourn's Folly's folklore, with children daring one another to stay inside the shadowy mansion for just a minute. Those brave enough to enter are teased with the legend of "Mournstead's Folly"—the supposed curse that afflicts anyone who stays inside for more than a minute, leaving them doomed to Edgar's same fate.

The "Folly" in the town's name became both a memory and a warning—a reminder of life's fleeting peace, of dreams that crumble, and of mysteries that remain unsolved.

### The Mournstead Mansion and Its New Owners

The old Mournstead Mansion has always been a point of superstition, the kind of place people nod toward with a knowing look but rarely talk about. But everything changed when *Walter Barstow* and his business partner, *Marlon Voss*, showed up out of the blue. Two strangers moving into Mourn's Folly at once would be enough to get the town talking, but buying *the mansion*? That's the sort of thing folks hadn't seen in years.

Now, for the first time in ages, the mansion stirs with activity, its windows lit up and its old rooms alive with echoes of hammers and saws. Voss has been all over town, chatting with the locals and hiring every able-bodied worker he can find to help restore the place. It's said he's got a list as long as a noble's arm for the things he needs. Anyone who's willing to work—and some who were a bit hesitant—have signed on, drawn by Voss's silver tongue and the *very* good pay. It's not every day folks around here see that kind of coin, especially from someone like him, so easygoing and quick with a friendly smile.

### Rumors and Whispers

Not everyone is completely comfortable with the idea. Most townsfolk will tell you in hushed voices that there's something unsettling about that house, something best left forgotten. But the lure of a warm pocket and the mystery of Barstow and Voss are enough to get people talking. 

- "Who is this Barstow fellow, anyway?" they ask, for no one's seen him about town.  
- Voss isn't shy about saying wonderful things about his business partner, who purchased both the mansion and an old shop in town they plan to turn into an antique store.  

Whenever anyone asks about Barstow's presence or whereabouts, though, Voss's answers are charm-filled but vague. He's quick to ease any worries with a friendly smile, and before anyone realizes, he's steered the conversation elsewhere, leaving people none the wiser.

### Superstition Meets Opportunity

Of course, that hasn't stopped the stories from flowing. To the townsfolk, the Mournstead mansion is still haunted, and recent renovations have only revived old tales. A few workers swear they've heard creaks and strange whispers in the empty upper rooms, or the faint sound of footsteps when there's no one around. 

*"Just old wood settling,"* Voss tells them with a grin, but that doesn't stop the workers from sharing their tales over drinks at the tavern each night.  

*"You don't live in a house like that and come out the same,"* some locals say, with a knowing nod.

Despite their superstitions, the townsfolk can't help but feel a flicker of excitement. After all, it's been ages since anything like this has happened here. Rumors ripple through the town like wildfire, each one more colorful than the last, as everyone wonders what new life these strangers will bring to Mourn's Folly—unaware, perhaps, that some shadows are better left undisturbed.
