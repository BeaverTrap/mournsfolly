### Description of the Sailor's State

- **Appearance:**
  - The missing sailor from the previous night stumbles into town, covered in river muck and reeds.
  - His skin is sickly pale with a greenish tinge, his eyes hollow and lifeless. Torn clothes and bite marks mar his arms, hinting at scavengers during his time in the river.

- **Behavior:**
  - His movements are jerky and slow, his gaze unfocused. He mutters about "the darkness" or something "dragging from the deep," heightening the eerie tone without revealing his transformation.
  - Suddenly, the sailor lunges at a nearby townsfolk, weakly attempting to bite, driven by an overwhelming hunger rather than aggression.

### The Sailor's "Companions"

- **Afflicted Followers:**
  - Several figures trail behind him, displaying the same pallid skin and lifeless eyes. They shuffle clumsily and moan incoherently.
  - These are not full-fledged vampires or zombies but feral thralls created by Barstow's indirect influence. They act on primal urges to feed, retaining none of their former selves.

> **Scene Description:**  
> As dusk settles over Mourn's Folly, a distant commotion stirs near the town square. Townsfolk murmur in clusters, their voices low with worry. Emerging from the shadows near the docks is a lone figureâ€”a man stumbling forward, his steps slow and unsteady.  
>  
> His ghostly pale skin glistens as murky river water drips from his torn clothes, heavy with reeds and muck. His glassy, unfocused eyes stare straight ahead. A low, guttural groan escapes as he lurches closer, his movements unnatural.  
>  
> One of his crewmates cautiously approaches, but the sailor suddenly lunges, mouth agape as if to bite. Panic ripples through the crowd as more figures emerge from the dimly lit streets, sharing the sailor's waterlogged, lifeless state. Villagers and crew pull back in fear, whispering of curses or illness spreading through the town.

### For the PCs

- **Immediate Challenge:**
  - The PCs must engage as the feral beings attack nearby townsfolk. PCs may choose to subdue them without lethal force, though these afflicted individuals will attempt to claw and bite.

- **Skill Checks:**
  - **Medicine Check (DC 13):**  
    Reveals that the sailor's wounds suggest prolonged submersion underwater and an unnatural pallor resembling early vampiric transformation.
  - **Insight or Religion Check (DC 15):**  
    Suggests dark magic or undeath, possibly necromancy or a curse. The PCs won't immediately suspect vampirism but will sense something unnatural.

- **Aftermath and Repercussions:**
  - Neutralizing the threat prompts villagers to speculate about a spreading "plague."  
  - The distraction allows Barstow's crate to reach the mansion unnoticed, deepening the mystery.

### Outcome and Consequences

- **Distraction from the Manor:**
  - The zombie-like incident diverts the PCs' attention, ensuring Barstow's shipment arrives without interference.

- **Foreshadowing:**
  - The event hints at Barstow's vampiric influence, keeping the PCs unaware of the full scope of the threat.

- **Investigation Opportunities:**
  - PCs may trace the sailor's origin, uncovering subtle clues about Barstow's machinations while heightening tension.

### After the Fight

If the PCs inspect the bodies, they notice:

- **Observations:**
  - The corpses have irregular, ragged bite marks, as though made by humans in a frenzied state.  
  - Signs of bloating and decomposition obscure specific patterns.

- **Checks:**
  - **Medicine or Investigation Check (DC 15):**
    - **Success:** The PCs identify the bites as human but erratic, suggesting the attackers were in a primal, frenzied state.
    - **Failure:** The PCs cannot discern anything specific due to the decomposition and bloating.
