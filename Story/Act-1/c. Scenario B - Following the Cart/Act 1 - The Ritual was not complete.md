This accelerates events and leaves the vampire, Walter Barstow, weakened. Without consecrated ground to rest during the day, he is forced to take up residence in one of the town’s neighborhoods. 

In his desperation, Barstow begins creating Feral Vampires and a few Vampire Thralls, hastening his plans to dominate Mourn’s Folly while exposing the town to his dark influence.
