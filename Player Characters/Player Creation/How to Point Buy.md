### Level 13 Adjustments and Bonuses

At level 13, characters have accumulated additional bonuses, feats, and items that amplify their starting stats:

- **Ability Score Increases (ASIs)**: Characters may have already added points to key abilities as they leveled up.
- **Racial and Background Bonuses**: These modifiers apply after using the 27-point buy system, further shaping your character’s strengths.
- **Class Features**: Higher-level abilities, like spellcasting and Extra Attack, depend on well-planned ability scores, making this system vital for long-term balance and effectiveness.
