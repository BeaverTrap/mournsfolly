title: Guide - A Veilwarden of the Wilds
---


As one of *Mourn's Folly*'s Veilwardens, the Guide serves as a guardian of the wilderness, patrolling the deep woods and borderlands that surround the town. Their duties include watching for signs of danger, maintaining trails, and ensuring that the balance of nature remains undisturbed by those who would exploit or harm it. Veilwardens rotate shifts, spending three months in the wilds followed by one month of shore-leave in *Mourn's Folly*. Even during their time in town, their connection to the wilds is unmistakableâ€”they carry themselves with a quiet authority and are often consulted on matters concerning the natural world.

The Guide's return to *Mourn's Folly* coincides with strange changes near the Mournstead mansion. The influx of strangers and the unusual activity in the surrounding forests have raised their suspicions. While others dismiss the signs, the Guide senses something unnatural at play and remains vigilant, ready to step in if these disturbances escalate into a threat to the town or its borders.

## Personal Focus

The Guide's devotion to the wilds stems from a deep respect for the land and its rhythms. They see themselves as a steward, not just of the wilderness but of the delicate balance between nature and civilization. While they value solitude and the peace of the wilds, their time in *Mourn's Folly* reminds them of the people they protect and the importance of their role as a bridge between these two worlds.

## History and Deeds

The Guide has proven their worth through years of service as a Veilwarden. Early in their career, they thwarted a poaching ring that was decimating rare wildlife, tracking the poachers for weeks before dismantling their operation. They have led townsfolk safely through treacherous terrain, escorting stranded travelers back to *Mourn's Folly* during harsh storms.

Their most notable feat was fending off a feral beast that had strayed too close to the town's outskirts, protecting both the people and the creature by luring it back to its natural habitat without unnecessary violence. They've also worked alongside adventurers, aiding in the recovery of a lost artifact deep within an overgrown ruin. These deeds have earned them respect not only as a protector of the wilds but as someone capable of navigating the unseen dangers of the borderlands.

## Residence in Mourn's Folly

The Guide stays in a simple cabin near the eastern edge of the town during their month of shore-leave, close to the woodlands they patrol. The cabin is sparsely furnished, with most of the space dedicated to equipment storage and maps of the surrounding area. Its proximity to the wilds ensures they remain connected to their duties, even when technically off-duty. (*Building 46*)
