As the eldest child of the family that took control of *Mourn's Folly* after Edgar Mournstead's disappearance, the Fallen Heir was raised to believe in their family's destiny to lead the town. Their upbringing was steeped in tales of ambition, tradition, and entitlement, shaping their vision of themselves as the rightful inheritor of their family's influence.

With the recent sale of the Mournstead Mansion deed to Marlon Voss, the heir sees an opportunity to cement their family's importance by revitalizing the town. They are deeply involved in monitoring the mansion's restoration and often speak of it as a symbol of the town's futureâ€”and by extension, their family's legacy. Despite occasional resistance from skeptical townsfolk, the heir remains steadfast in their belief that these changes will ensure their family's place at the center of *Mourn's Folly*'s future.

## Personal Focus

The Fallen Heir is driven by a need to prove their worth and secure their family's legacy.

## History and Deeds

The Fallen Heir has never shied away from dangerous opportunities to make a name for themselves:  
- **Retrieving a Cursed Artifact**: When word spread of a cursed artifact buried in the Mournstead forest, they joined adventurers to retrieve it. Though the journey was fraught with traps and spectral guardians, they returned triumphant, presenting the artifact as a treasure for their family and a boon for the town's reputation.  
- **Recovering Trade Records**: They led an expedition to a ruined outpost near the Kendausk River, recovering records that restored access to forgotten trade routes. This venture brought wealth to *Mourn's Folly*, but whispers arose that it was more about personal glory than aiding the town.  
- **Countering a Pirate Raid**: During a raid on a merchant caravan, the heir coordinated a counterattack, hiring mercenaries to reclaim stolen goods. While successful, the cost of their plan and the mercenaries' methods drew mixed reactions from the townsfolk.

Through these exploits, the heir walks the line between heroism and ambition, always striving to leave their mark on *Mourn's Folly*.
