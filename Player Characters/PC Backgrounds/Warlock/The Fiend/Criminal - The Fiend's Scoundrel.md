## Description

Once known as the town's resident troublemaker, the Fiend's Scoundrel always flirted with danger. However, their life of petty crime took a dark turn after they stumbled upon a relic hidden in an old, forgotten corner of *Mourn's Folly*. Upon touching it, they forged a bargain with a powerful fiend from the Lower Planes, gaining supernatural powers at the cost of unknown favors to be claimed later. 

Since that fateful day, they've felt the fiend's influence during moments of temptation, subtly nudging them toward actions that cause chaos and discord in the town. The arrival of **Marlon Voss** and the mansion's renovations have piqued their curiosity. Something about Voss's secrets feels like an irresistible invitation for mischief—and they’re certain their patron would approve of them stirring up chaos to uncover the truth.
