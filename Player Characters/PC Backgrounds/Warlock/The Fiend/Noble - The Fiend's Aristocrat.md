## Description

Born into a once-prominent family that quietly governs *Mourn's Folly*, the Fiend's Aristocrat struck a pact with an infernal being to secure their family's legacy and elevate their influence in an ever-changing world. With **Marlon Voss's** arrival and the restoration of the old mansion, they see an opportunity to reclaim their family's former glory. Drawing strength from their fiendish patron, they wield their power with cunning and poise, subtly manipulating situations to uphold their family's name.

While respected by the townsfolk, thereâ€™s an undercurrent of unease surrounding them, as their calculated ambition treads a dangerous line. They are relentless in their quest to ensure their family's position remains unchallenged, even as whispers of infernal influence linger behind their polished demeanor.
