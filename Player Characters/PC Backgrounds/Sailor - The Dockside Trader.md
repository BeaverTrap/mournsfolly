## Overview

A seasoned trader and river guide, the Dockside Trader frequently travels along the **Kendausk River**, which winds through *Mourn's Folly*. Known to the townsfolk as both a reliable supplier and a source of fresh tales, they stop regularly to deliver goods and supplies. With a keen eye for anything unusual, their extensive travels make them a natural observer, always curious about new faces and strange happenings.

The recent restoration of the Mournstead Mansion and the opening of the new antique shop have sparked their interest, providing fresh stories to share along the river route. Friendly but sharp-eyed, they thrive on catching up on local gossip and weaving tales of the river and distant towns into the daily buzz.
