## Step 4: Equipment & Starting Gear

- **Background-Specific and Pre-Assigned Gear**:
    
    - Equipment is directly tied to the chosen **background**, reflecting its role, theme, and the survival-oriented tone of the campaign.
    - Each background provides **pre-defined gear** suitable for **level 13** characters to ensure consistency and balance.

- **Weapon and Gear Selection**:
    
    - Players may select **weapon types** (e.g., melee, ranged, or spell foci) based on their character’s class and background.
    - Starting supplies also include survival essentials, such as food rations, rope, and light sources, tied to the campaign's gritty, resource-driven nature.

- **DM-Approved Customization**:
    
    - Players may request specific or customized gear if approved by the DM.
    - Custom items must align with the campaign’s narrative and maintain balance.

## Step 5: Choose Spells (for Spellcasters)

- Select spells available to your class up to **7th-level**.
- Choose spells that complement your background and role. For instance:
    - A Bard might favor charm and influence spells.
    - A Cleric could focus on healing and protective spells.
    - A Wizard might lean on damage and control spells.

## Step 6: Develop Your Backstory and Faith

- **Integrate Your Background**: Connect your character's background to **Mournstead Folly** and its story.
    - Explore ties to the town, relationships with its residents, or intrigue regarding recent events.

- **Deity and Faith**:
    - Characters following deities may carry **symbolic trinkets** (e.g., a holy symbol).
    - These trinkets can add depth to roleplay and may grant narrative effects at the DM’s discretion, such as repelling dark presences.
    - Consider the role of your deity in your character’s journey, whether as a guide, source of power, or inspiration.
