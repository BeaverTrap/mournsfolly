## Using the 27-Point Buy System

For your characters at level 5, we're using the **27-point buy** system to customize ability scores. This approach gives you flexibility to shape your character's strengths and weaknesses while keeping things balanced for the campaign.

### How the 27-Point Buy System Works

| **Score** | **Point Cost** |
|-----------|----------------|
| 8         | 0              |
| 9         | 1              |
| 10        | 2              |
| 11        | 3              |
| 12        | 4              |
| 13        | 5              |
| 14        | 7              |
| 15        | 9              |

- **Maximum Starting Stat**: 15 (before adding any racial or background bonuses).  
- **Minimum Starting Stat**: 8 (no cost to take this value).

With this system, you have **27 points to spend** on your character's ability scores. This allows you to balance high scores in key areas while staying within your budget. For example:
- A Fighter might invest heavily in **Strength** and **Constitution**.
- A Bard may prioritize **Charisma** and **Dexterity**.

This setup ensures balance, allows for customization, and gives your character a compelling starting point to showcase their strengths and quirks.
