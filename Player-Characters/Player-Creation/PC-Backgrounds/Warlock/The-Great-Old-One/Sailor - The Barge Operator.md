## Description

Once a sailor braving the unpredictable seas, the Barge Operator’s life changed forever during a devastating storm. Amid the chaos, they encountered a strange and incomprehensible presence. In exchange for their survival, this entity promised eternal curiosity and vigilance, binding them to the whispers of the **Great Old One**. Haunted by fragments of forbidden knowledge, they left the open waters behind, seeking solace and stability along the **Kendausk River**.

Now operating a barge, they make regular deliveries to *Mourn's Folly*, with increasing frequency due to **Marlon Voss’s** recent supply orders for his and **Barstow’s** ventures. These trips offer the Barge Operator opportunities to connect with the townsfolk, share tales of their past adventures, and quietly observe the strange undercurrents of activity within the community. Though they appear as a humble transporter, their otherworldly vigilance ensures they’re never far from the heart of unfolding mysteries.
