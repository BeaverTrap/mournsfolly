## Description

One of *Mourn's Folly*'s most captivating performers, the Fiend's Performer has charmed audiences with their undeniable talent and flair. However, their allure isn’t entirely natural. One fateful night, they struck a bargain with a powerful being from the Lower Planes, who promised them fame and influence in exchange for loyalty.

Now, their performances carry an enigmatic edge, captivating and unsettling in equal measure. Since **Marlon Voss's** arrival and the renovations at the mansion, they’ve felt a strange pull toward the growing activity around town, as if their fiendish patron is guiding them toward the unfolding mysteries. Drawn by the allure of secrets—and the potential for even greater fame—they’re eager to leverage their charm and influence to uncover the truth behind Voss’s plans.
