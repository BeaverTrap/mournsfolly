## Description

Known around *Mourn's Folly* as a bit of a rascal, the Fey Trickster has always had a knack for charming the townsfolk and talking their way out of trouble. However, few know the truth behind their talents. A chance encounter in a nearby grove with a powerful Fey spirit resulted in an unexpected pact. This Archfey now grants them subtle magic to enhance their charisma and deception, abilities they wield in tricks and schemes that bring both amusement and suspicion to the community.

Recently, the Fey Trickster has taken a keen interest in **Marlon Voss** and his antiques business, curious if any of the items hold enchantments that might deepen their connection to the Fey realm or intrigue their mysterious patron. With the arrival of new faces in *Mourn's Folly*, they sense an opportunity to uncover something magical... and maybe stir up a little mischief along the way.
