## Description

In *Mourn's Folly*, the Enchanted Thespian is celebrated for captivating performances that even the most skeptical townsfolk can't ignore. However, their charm isn't entirely natural. A fateful encounter with an Archfey granted them an otherworldly allure and the subtle power to enchant audiences. This Fey patron encourages grand theatrics and occasional mischief, subtly guiding them toward the mysteries now brewing in the town.

With the arrival of **Marlon Voss** and his antique business, the Thespian's curiosity is piqued. The mansion's restoration and the intrigue surrounding Voss's shop feel like the perfect stage for adventure. Drawn by the allure of uncovering secrets that might amuse their patron, the Thespian steps boldly into the unknown.
