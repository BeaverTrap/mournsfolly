## Description

A reclusive figure on the outskirts of *Mourn's Folly*, the Forest Lure spends their days immersed in nature, foraging and concocting herbal remedies for the occasional villager in need. Their connection to the wild runs deeper than most realize. During a solitary trek, they encountered an enchanting Archfey who offered a pact in exchange for their lifelong curiosity and service to the fey. This bond imbued them with mystical powers and an innate connection to the hidden magical essence of the world.

Now, they carry an air of whimsy and mystery that unsettles some townsfolk, who can't decide if they're a benevolent healer or an enigmatic meddler. With the arrival of **Marlon Voss** and the renovations at the mansion, they've felt a strange pull. Subtle energies hint that Voss’s presence may hold answers to the magical currents they’re attuned to.
