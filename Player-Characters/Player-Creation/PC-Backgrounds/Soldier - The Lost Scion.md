## Overview

A former soldier and recent arrival to *Mourn's Folly*, the Lost Scion has quietly settled into the town over the past few months, driven by a personal mission to uncover a hidden piece of their family's history. Secretly, they are the last known descendant of Edgar Mournstead, sharing a deep connection with their ancestor, who, like them, led a life of service before seeking peace in the small town. This bond fuels their desire to reclaim the Mournstead legacy, though without proof of their lineage, it remains a private and unspoken goal.

Initially met with hesitation by the locals, the Lost Scion's steady presence and practical demeanor have earned the town's respect over time. Quietly, they search for a way to explore the Mournstead Manor and uncover evidence of their heritage. However, with Voss and Barstow's recent acquisition of the property, they fear their chance may have slipped away. Despite this, they remain hopeful, keeping their lineage a closely guarded secret while navigating the town's social web with careful purpose.
