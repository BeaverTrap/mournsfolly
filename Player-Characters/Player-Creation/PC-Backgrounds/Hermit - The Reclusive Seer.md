title: Hermit - The Reclusive Seer
---


Living on the outskirts of *Mourn's Folly*, the Reclusive Seer is a figure of mystery and quiet authority. Known for their skill in crafting herbal remedies and deciphering old superstitions, they spend most of their days in solitude, immersed in their studies and rituals. Their reclusive lifestyle has earned them a reputation as both a healer and an eccentric. Venturing into town only on a set schedule, they fulfill orders, sell their unique wares, and gather supplies before quickly retreating to the safety of their isolated home.

The recent commotion around the Mournstead mansion has unsettled them. Whispers of old stories and rumors of dark forces stir memories of warnings and legends they've long studied. Though they avoid entangling themselves in the lives of others, they quietly prepare, sensing that the time for their knowledge to be tested may be drawing near.

## Personal Focus

The Seer values solitude and independence, finding peace in the quiet of their home and the rhythm of their work. They are driven by a need to uncover and preserve ancient wisdom, blending practical knowledge of herbs with an intuitive sense of the supernatural. While they often seem detached, their vigilance and preparedness show a deep-seated desire to protect *Mourn's Folly* from unseen threats.

## History and Deeds

The Reclusive Seer's reputation was built over years of study and service. They first gained recognition by curing a mysterious illness that spread through a nearby farming community, creating a remedy from rare herbs gathered in the wilds. Their deep knowledge of local plants and their supernatural insights have guided the town through difficult times, including a harvest blight they helped mitigate with a carefully crafted potion.

On several occasions, their foresight has saved lives. Once, they interpreted an ominous dream shared by multiple townsfolk as a warning of a coming flood, leading to quick action that protected homes and livelihoods. Their understanding of ancient rituals also proved invaluable in helping adventurers cleanse a cursed artifact, preventing its corruption from spreading. Though they prefer to work quietly, these deeds have made them a respected, if enigmatic, figure in *Mourn's Folly*.

## Residence in Mourn's Folly

The Seer lives in a secluded cabin nestled in the woods just beyond the town's borders, close enough to reach *Mourn's Folly* on foot but far enough to ensure privacy. Their home is a blend of natural materials and strange artifacts, with drying herbs, handwritten journals, and alchemical equipment scattered throughout. This isolated location reflects their preference for solitude and their connection to the natural and spiritual worlds. (*Located beyond the mapped area*)
