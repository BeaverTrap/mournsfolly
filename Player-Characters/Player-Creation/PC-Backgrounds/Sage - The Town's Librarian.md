## Overview

As the librarian of *Mourn's Folly*, the Sage has spent years curating and preserving the knowledge housed in the town's small but surprisingly rich Library of Antiquities. Their days are spent cataloging dusty tomes, deciphering ancient scripts, and sharing fascinating stories with curious townsfolk. Known for their sharp intellect and encyclopedic memory, they are the go-to person for historical queries, arcane riddles, and even local gossip wrapped in folklore.

With the restoration of the Mournstead Mansion and the arrival of Marlon Voss, the Sage sees an opportunity to delve into the mansion's forgotten past and uncover secrets that could elevate the library's statusâ€”or protect the town from hidden dangers.

## Personal Focus

The Sage treasures their role as a steward of knowledge, viewing books and relics as pieces of a larger puzzle that ties together the past and present. However, they struggle with frustration at being underestimated by those who view the library as a quaint curiosity rather than a vault of invaluable knowledge. Their work is driven by a deep desire to uncover the truth behind *Mourn's Folly*'s most enduring mysteries, even if it means taking risks beyond their comfort zone.

## History and Deeds

The Sage's passion for history began in their youth when they unearthed an ancient, waterlogged tome from the ruins near the Kendausk River. Its cryptic writing sparked a lifelong fascination with lost knowledge. Over the years, they traveled to distant cities to study under renowned scholars and eventually returned to *Mourn's Folly* to breathe new life into its neglected library.

Some of their notable achievements include:  
- **Restoring the Archives**: Revitalized the library's crumbling archives and recovered rare books through trade and careful negotiation.  
- **Assisting Adventurers**: Identified enchanted relics and translated arcane inscriptions to aid adventuring parties.  
- **Solving the Cryptic Poem**: Deciphered a cryptic poem that revealed the location of a sacred artifact, which was later used to protect the town from a vampire thrall.  
- **Ending the Harvest Blight**: During a town-wide crisis, their research into ancient farming rituals uncovered a forgotten technique to cleanse the land of creeping decay, saving crops and livelihoods.
