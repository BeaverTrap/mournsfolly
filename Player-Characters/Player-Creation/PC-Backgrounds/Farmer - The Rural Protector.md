A steadfast farmer whose family has tilled the same fields for generations, the Rural Protector is a pillar of hard work and perseverance in *Mourn's Folly*. Their days are spent tending crops, caring for livestock, and keeping a watchful eye on the land they know better than anyone else. Their practical attitude and deep connection to nature have earned them respect throughout the community, even from those who see their quiet demeanor as aloofness.

Lately, a gnawing sense of unease has crept into their usually steady routine. The restoration of the old Mournstead mansion has disturbed the balance of the land in ways they can't explain. They've noticed small signs of change—livestock spooked without reason, plants withering in patches of otherwise healthy soil, and strange noises carried on the wind at night. Though they’ve never been one to indulge in superstition, they can’t shake the feeling that something unnatural is brewing, and they are determined to protect their home and town if the need arises.

## History and Deeds

The Rural Protector has always been more than just a farmer. As a youth, they defended their family's homestead from a pack of prowling dire wolves, using ingenuity and sheer determination to keep their loved ones safe. Over the years, they became the go-to protector for neighboring farmers, helping to fend off raiders, exterminate a giant insect infestation, and even chase off a marauding owlbear that threatened the town's livestock.

Beyond their physical strength, they have demonstrated a keen understanding of nature, using their knowledge of the land to track predators, find lost animals, and cultivate crops even under difficult conditions. When a nearby flood threatened to destroy several farms, they coordinated efforts to build barriers and redirect water, saving countless livelihoods. These deeds have cemented their reputation as a capable and dependable figure in *Mourn's Folly*, always ready to lend a hand when the community is in need.
