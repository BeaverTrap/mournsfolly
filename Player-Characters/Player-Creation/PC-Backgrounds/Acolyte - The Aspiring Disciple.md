## Description

A devout follower of Lathander, the Aspiring Disciple serves as a beacon of hope in *Mourn's Folly*. Raised in or drawn to the town's humble chapel, they have become Father Cedric's apprentice, performing blessings, tending the sick, and maintaining the chapel's gardens. Though still finding their footing, they are seen as a rising star of Lathander's light, even as they privately struggle with self-doubt about their readiness for the challenges ahead.

The chapel, with its golden-hued sunstones and herb gardens, is both their sanctuary and responsibility. Beyond spiritual duties, the disciple is also viewed as a protector and guide, standing as a symbol of renewal against the encroaching shadows.

Their bond is complex—a mix of reverence, concern, and growing independence.
