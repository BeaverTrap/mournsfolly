## Description

A charming and quick-witted trickster, the Smooth Talker has recently returned to *Mourn's Folly*, a place they once called home but left behind in search of bigger opportunities—and bigger marks. For years, they drifted from town to town, running cons and hustles that always ended with a narrow escape. Now, they claim to have turned over a new leaf, seeking a fresh start back in the quiet familiarity of their hometown.

The arrival of Marlon Voss and the mysterious renovation of the Mournstead mansion has, however, reawakened their instincts. The promise of new money flowing into town and whispers of the mansion’s eerie history feel like the perfect setup for one last, legendary con. For now, they remain an observer, blending in with the townsfolk, listening carefully, and always ready to charm their way out of trouble.

## Personal Focus

The Smooth Talker is torn between their desire for a clean slate and their love of the con. They thrive on the thrill of deception—the careful setup and the grand reveal—but wonder if they can ever leave their old ways behind. Their return to *Mourn's Folly* is both an attempt to reinvent themselves and an opportunity to test if they’re destined to remain a trickster forever.

## History and Deeds

The Smooth Talker’s cunning has earned them a reputation across the region. Notable exploits include:  

- Infiltrating a noble’s masquerade ball to steal a priceless artifact.  
- Convincing a group of bandits to hand over their spoils.  
- Posing as a traveling cleric to gain the trust (and coin) of an entire village.  
- Orchestrating a trap to humiliate a relentless bounty hunter, leaving them penniless and disgraced.  

These deeds, while impressive, have also left a trail of enemies and unfinished business. Their return to *Mourn's Folly* is as much about avoiding their past as it is about embracing new opportunities.

(*Located in The Folly’s Rest Tavern*)

## Personal Item: **Deck of Marked Cards**

A finely crafted deck of playing cards subtly marked in a way only the Smooth Talker can recognize. This deck has been a constant companion in countless scams and games of chance. Beyond its utility, it serves as a symbol of their skill and a reminder of the life they’ve tried (and often failed) to leave behind.
