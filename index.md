## 🕯️ About Mourn's Folly

**Mourn's Folly** is a survival horror campaign inspired by the grit of classic monster horror and the visceral intensity of pulp horror comics. The campaign immerses players in a relentless world of danger, where the undead roam freely and survival requires ingenuity, courage, and the will to endure.

This is a campaign where:

- **Every Shadow Hides a Secret.** Drawing from old-world horror and the stark visuals of vintage comics, **Mourn's Folly** delivers an atmospheric adventure steeped in tension. The creeping dread is ever-present, and the horrors you face are both terrifying and deeply personal.

- **Choices Matter.** Every decision, from scavenging a crumbling farmhouse to sparing an infected townsfolk, has lasting consequences. The town of Mournstead Folly and its people evolve based on your actions, forcing you to weigh every choice.

- **Survival is Key.** Using the **Dungeon Delicacies** system, food and foraging become central to survival. Prepare meals under the pressure of dwindling resources, scavenge during daylight hours, and harness supernatural recipes with both powerful benefits and chilling risks.

### Survival Horror Defined
Mourn's Folly challenges players to think strategically and adapt to an ever-changing landscape of danger. With limited resources and constant threats, your party must:

- **Forage Under Pressure.** Scavenge vampire-haunted ruins and eerie forests for supplies, balancing risk and reward with each decision.

- **Use Culinary Buffs.** Turn scraps and ingredients into meals that provide vital survival benefits, but beware of the trade-offs and dangers lurking in each recipe.

- **Confront the Supernatural.** Embrace the dark history of the town through mysterious, supernatural recipes that grant immense power—at a cost.

- **Survive the Night.** As the sun sets, the town becomes a battleground. Forage while the light remains, then face the relentless horrors of the dark.

**Dive into the shadows, endure the trials, and uncover the truth of Mournstead.**
