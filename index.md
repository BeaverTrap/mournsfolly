# Welcome to Mourn's Folly 🌙

Tucked away in a misty valley, Mournstead Folly is a quiet, insular town where winding paths and shadowed lanes carve through clusters of timeworn homes. Encircled by dense, ancient woods and rugged hills, the town feels both sheltered and cut off from the outside world. Its centerpiece is a modest square, paved with uneven cobblestones and anchored by a weathered stone fountain. Narrow streets radiate outward, connecting a scattering of humble shops, a simple chapel, and the local tavern where townsfolk gather at day's end.

The air carries the faint scent of damp earth and wood smoke, and lanterns burn low at night, casting flickering light through the ever-present haze. The Folly thrives on routine—its grain mill hums steadily by the creek, and fishermen unload their daily catch at the docks. Life here is slow and deliberate, built on the rhythms of an isolated community that seems untouched by time.

Visitors find the townsfolk polite and welcoming, though their smiles often fail to reach their eyes. There’s an unspoken wariness that lingers in the air, a sense that the Folly guards its secrets as fiercely as its people guard their traditions.
