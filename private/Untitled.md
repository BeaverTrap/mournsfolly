#### **Starting Level: 1**

- **Focus:** Introduce the town of **Mournstead Folly**, the surrounding world, and _Dungeon Delicacies (DD)_ mechanics.
    
- **Themes:** Small-town mystery, light-hearted exploration, low-stakes survival.
    
- **Activities:**
    
    - **Bounties:** Offered by **Black's Market**. These serve as the players’ introduction to DD’s monster harvesting and cooking systems.
        - Examples: Hunting wolves in **Willowshade Thicket**, investigating a bandit camp near **Gravenford**, or clearing rats from a nearby grain mill.
    - **Foraging & Cooking:** Players will forage in biomes such as **Amberleaf Glade** and **Willowshade Thicket**, while learning to create basic recipes with minor buffs.
    - **Small Caves/Dungeons:** Dungeons around the **Silvermaw Peaks** and **Mournstead Folly** will feature beginner-level challenges and harvesting opportunities.
    - **Town Roleplay:** Players meet Mournstead’s townsfolk and learn about its politics, traditions, and NPCs, building relationships.
- **Goal:** By Level 4, players should feel connected to Mournstead Folly and understand the systems of DD and basic exploration. Subtle foreshadowing about a "mysterious investor" (Voss) can begin to sow intrigue.

#### **XP Milestone 1: Players Reach Level 5**

- **Trigger Event:** **Marlon Voss arrives** in Mournstead Folly. He purchases the old manor and leases a shop for his antiques and curiosities business.
    
    - **Tone Shift:** Voss brings prosperity to the town, hiring townsfolk and adventurers. At first, he is polite, charming, and helpful, building trust with both NPCs and players.
- **Focus:** Mid-tier adventuring and subtle narrative escalation.
    
- **Themes:** Growing danger, quests with moral ambiguity, and manipulation.
    
- **Activities:**
    
    - **Voss's Quests:** Voss offers jobs to players—tasks such as retrieving magical artifacts or investigating ruins. These quests seem innocent but secretly benefit Barstow’s eventual arrival.
        - Example: "Retrieve this rare artifact from a forgotten crypt." (It’s actually part of a ritual or used to weaken local wards protecting Mournstead.)
    - **Black's Rivalry:** Black grows suspicious of Voss, offering bounties targeting monsters or cultists tied to Voss's activities.
    - **Stronger Dungeons & Bounties:** Players venture to more dangerous areas (e.g., **Ashenwild**, **Dusk Ridge**, and **Blackthorn Forest**) where higher-level monsters can be harvested for rare ingredients.
- **Foreshadowing:** Strange phenomena begin to creep into the region (e.g., livestock going missing, odd weather patterns, villagers acting strangely). While these events aren't tied directly to Voss (yet), they signal the growing threat of Barstow.

#### **XP Milestone 2: Players Reach Level 8**

- **Trigger Event:** **Walter Barstow arrives**. He takes up residence in the old manor with Voss and begins his takeover of the town.
    
    - **Tone Shift:** The town grows darker as Barstow's influence spreads. Strange disappearances increase, and formerly friendly NPCs act distant or suspicious.
    - **Thralls & Vampires:** Barstow begins turning townsfolk into thralls and vampires. Some may be NPCs the players have bonded with, creating emotional stakes.
- **Focus:** Open conflict as Barstow establishes nests and consolidates power.
    
- **Themes:** Desperation, corruption, and the creeping loss of Mournstead Folly.
    
- **Activities:**
    
    - **Vampiric Nests:** Barstow’s thralls and vampires create nests in nearby dungeons and caves. Players must destroy these nests to slow his spread.
        - Example: A cult forms in **Amberleaf Glade**, where Barstow’s thralls hold rituals to turn willing townsfolk into vampires.
    - **Bounty Board Upgrades:** Black’s Market introduces elite-level bounties targeting Barstow’s agents and monstrous allies. These include powerful vampires, undead beasts, and corrupted townsfolk.
    - **Faction Choices:** Players must decide whether to align with Black, the town’s remaining resistance, or another faction to combat Barstow. Factions offer different advantages (e.g., unique magic items, lore, or combat allies).
    - **Harvesting Opportunities:** Barstow’s spreading corruption alters local ecosystems, introducing new harvestable creatures and rare crafting materials.
- **Barstow's Tactics:** Barstow uses Voss to manipulate the players, either through false alliances or subterfuge. Voss’s transformation into a thrall could occur during this phase.
